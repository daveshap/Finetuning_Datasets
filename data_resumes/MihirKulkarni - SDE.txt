PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  
Software Developer , Shweta Software Systems . Mumbai, India               Jun 2020  - Jun 2021 
• Created an improved workflow for GSTIN number data entry by composing an automated Python script using an API to 
manage data entry for companies associated with GSTIN numbers.  
• Liaised with clients to analyze and confirm requirements for new product development of an Android app for payment tracking.  
• Collaborated with senior developer, presented concept designs and iterated through various candidates.  
• Constructed GUI and formulated syste m architecture to seamlessly integrate with employer’s main accounting software.  
• Applied new techniques and removed need for manual data entry, accomplishing a cost reduction of 600,000 INR per month.  
• Leveraged agile software development to have initial pr oduct ready in less than a month, with full delivery in five months.   
PROJECTS  
Pintos                      Aug 2022 – Present  
• Partnered with 3 OS engineers to understand and build a Linux -based operating system (Pintos), under Prof. Farshad Ghanei, 
along with documentation and careful auditing of project design.  
• Planned out how scheduling is handled by user -level libraries and kernel -level libraries using basic C lang constructs, as well as 
how concurrency, resource sharing and process prioritization work. Brainstormed with teammates to make key design decisions 
about architecture, readability and best practices.  
• Developed and executed rigorous stress testing dictated by operating system standards, including security, speed, robustness a nd 
space optimizations. Reduced memory lookups by up to 50%, utilizing translation lookaside buffers and relevant page 
replacement policies.  
RAFT concurrency using Go and Docker                Feb 2022  – May  2022 
• Headed a team of 3, advised by Dr. Bina Ramamurthy to compose RAFT concurrency for distributed systems. Conducted weekly 
meetings to resolve potential issues and ensure agile delivery.  
• Assembled algorithm using Go. Achieved full failure tolerance and recovery in less than 100ms of a node going down. Monitored  
relevant benchmarks under various work conditions.  
• Generated a client -server application on top of concurrency too lkit using PostgreSQL and providing access to a scalable API 
letting clients conduct CRUD operations with ease.  
Seam carving for content -aware resizing                          Apr 2022 – May 2022  
• Spearheaded a team to develop an implementation of the conte nt-aware resizing algorithm paper that was published in 
SIGGRAPH. Constructed dynamic programming prescribed in the original paper and examined options for quality evaluation.  
• Developed visualizations showing its effects, working entirely using MATLAB’s signal and image processing toolkit, advised 
and mentored by Dr. Nalini Ratha, an IEEE fellow and eminent author in the biometrics field. Discussed ways to make a more 
convincing  seam carve including different ways of computing image energy efficiently using energy function methodologies.  
   
ACHIEVEMENTS  
A presentation on Network Embedding as Matrix Factorization                       Mar 2022  
• Gave a talk at a college seminar on deep learning in graph networks. Presented a highly -cited paper from 2018 “Network 
Embedding as Matrix Factorization: Unifying DeepWalk, LINE, PTE and node2vec”.  
• Evaluated a comprehensive report of all four methods, in addition to doing a deep dive into foundations of derivations discussed 
in research paper.  Also had a discussion session with professor and fellow students on overall limitations of random walk 
methodologies in learning graph embeddings.
