ESSAY: I can't even remember when it was that I first started to question things. I think it was around the time when I was starting to learn more about the world and everything in it. I started to see that there were different sides to every story and that there were always people who disagreed with each other. It was confusing and frustrating, but I couldn't help but keep thinking about it.

I think the first time I really challenged a belief was when I was in high school. We were learning about different religions in history class and I remember hearing about how some people believe in multiple gods. I was shocked. I couldn't understand how anyone could believe in something like that. It just didn't make sense to me.

I asked my teacher about it and she said that people have different ways of looking at the world and that we should respect that. That was when I started to see that there is more to life than just what I believe. I began to question other things that I had always taken for granted and it was eye-opening.

Now, I'm not saying that I don't believe in anything anymore. But I have learned to be more open-minded and to respect other people's beliefs, even if I don't agree with them. I think that's important.
