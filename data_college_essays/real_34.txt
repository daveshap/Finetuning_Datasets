5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?
 

My laptop sits merely 3 feet away from my bed. “It wouldn’t take more than a second to reach it,” I convinced myself. But of course, nothing goes as planned. Smashing the snooze button on my phone, I would close my eyes, hoping to catch a few more minutes of sleep. But my desire to rest would simply take over.

 

Day after day, I overslept and missed my classes, dragging my grades down and escalating my anxiety, and yet, I still found no motivation to move a finger; worn out like I had traversed through a deep jungle, even though I had just laid in bed all day. 

 

Staring at my bedroom ceiling one night, I thought to myself, “Is it going to keep going on like this? Am I just going to allow this to happen?” No one was going to help me out of this. No one, but myself. Battling the heavy emotions that dragged my body down, I knew that I had to priotize my long term goals, no matter how tiring it seemed. With a sliver of motivation, I encouraged myself to slowly adjust into the regular classroom schedule and complete as many assignments as I mentally could. 

 

Throughout this conflict, I learned that sometimes, we need to breathe for a moment and have faith in ourselves. Everyday, we clash with our own minds, deciding which path would be best for us. Even if we follow the wrong road, we’ll keep on going and tackle or embrace any drawbacks. Allowing myself to slowly adapt back into the circle of life washed a wave of relief over me as I continued to strive for my best interest.
