 

Motivation has helped inspire me and continue working hard. I have always been a person that has been highly motivated not only due to my background but because of my desire to succeed. I would say being a motivational person not only to myself but sometimes to others has been a key skill in my life. At times people lack motivation to do certain things and I myself have been guilty of that too. Although I am a very highly motivated person I sometimes feel unmotivated. 

 

I believe that my motivation purely comes from my desire to succeed and accomplish my goals in life. Succeeding and accomplishing some of the goals I have put for myself would be nice but I would say my main motivation has been my parents along with my family. My mother and father both motivate me on a daily basis. Seeing how hard they have worked to give me a proper education along with a roof over my head has fueled me with motivation. 

 

I wake up every morning motivated to do something whether its at school or outside of it. I believe being a highly motivated person is a key skill in life as it shows that I am willing to work hard no matter the obstacles or if failure comes my way. I have failed many times in my life whether it's through a grade at school or learning something new outside of school. Failure has never stopped me, I have always been motivated to pick myself up and continue to try my  best to improve as I know I can become better. As far as I know I will continue to be motivated in life in order to accomplish one of my main goals of graduating college and receiving my diploma in my major that I study
