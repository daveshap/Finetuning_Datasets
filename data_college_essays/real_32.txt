As a part of the Mayor’s Youth Employment and Education program, I had an internship opportunity at my former middle school as a teaching assistant during the summer. Assigned to the cooking class - one of the many lessons students participated in - I never realized how arduous it was to lead a full classroom of young teenagers. Though I was just an assistant, chaos encircled the classroom. 

 

Chaos may be an understatement, as water splattered over the floors and sticky dough layered the tables, as you would expect from a group of eleven to fourteen year olds. But this couldn’t go on. I’ve had experience with teachers posing themselves as figures of authority and I can’t allow myself to do the same. To teach someone, I’ve realized that you need to understand their thought process as well as your own in order to approach a method that fits both individual minds. While jumbling with ingredients was entertaining, I was able to emphasize the value ingredients hold and how they act as pieces of a puzzle that will assemble into a mouthwatering dish. 

 

As a class, we did follow recipes but it’s not uncommon to flip the script. While aiding some students with their handmade bread dough, some doughs got ridiculously sticky while others became exorbitantly stiff. Through trial and error, not only did the students and I enjoy experimenting, we also learned to accept the fact that failure approaches us more frequently than we may think. But it’s only when you reflect on your frame of mind and confront the domineering challenges that you conquer the barriers you gallantly face. Adding more milk or flour could transfigure a solidified or tenacious ball of dough into a light, fluffy loaf.
