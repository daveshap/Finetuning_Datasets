Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

When I was on the swim team, every year, my team hosted an Aquathon, a two-hour swimming marathon where swimmers would swim as many laps as they could.

When I was little, I was diagnosed with anemia. It was a condition where I had fewer healthy red blood cells compared to the average person, and as a result, I got tired early when exercising or playing sports. It was why I never did any marathons or went far into any sport I did because I did not have the stamina and endurance to keep up with the other kids.

I was reluctant to do the Aquathon because of my condition, but I ultimately decided to try it.

After an hour passed, I was exhausted. I swam over 100 laps but did not take any breaks. A part of me was tired and wanted to go home. On the other hand, I was determined to keep going. To motivate myself, I set a goal to swim 200 laps. I felt more confident than ever and started swimming again.

"One minute left! You guys got this!" my coach yelled.

Up to that point, I swam 198 laps. I needed two more laps until I could make it to 200.
I started swimming, but I felt like I was swimming with weights on my arms and legs. I finished another lap to reach 199, but there was only a minute left. With no time to rest, I pushed forward with the energy I had left. Every stroke was one meter closer to achieving my goal.

Suddenly, my hand hit the wall.

I did it. I climbed out of the pool, ecstatic because I not only achieved the goal I set for myself but conquered my anemia.

As I gazed at the beautiful sunset on the horizon, I understood that my perseverance helped me finish strong in the Aquathon. Michael Jordan once said: "Never say never because limits, like fears, are often an illusion." This quote resonates with me because if I can overcome my anemia, who knows what else I can accomplish?
