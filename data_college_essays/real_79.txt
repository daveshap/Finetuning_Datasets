 

I come from a family of learners. Each time we sit at the dinner table, the room fills with questions. We spend those thirty minutes each day learning from each other and sharing our latest discoveries. My mom often comes to the table with an interesting psychological fact: did you know that moving your eyes side to side has been shown to reduce stress? My sister usually shares the latest thing she's seen on YouTube or Instagram, which spurs a fifteen -minute debate on whether or not it's true. In return, I contribute my thoughts on the recent Brazilian election or explain something I learned in history class.

Being around these people every day inspired my love of learning. I still remember the time my dad took me to his work and introduced me to a group of quants, where I spent fifteen minutes peppering them with questions about probabilistic stock market analysis before going home and coding my own Monte Carlo simulation. The emphasis on learning and teaching within my family has led to my dream of becoming a math professor. I want to use my love of math to instill in others the same passion for learning that has guided me through life.
