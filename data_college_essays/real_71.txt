Having English as my third language, after French and Arabic, has been an educational barrier for me.
When I moved to California from Lebanon to pursue my education, I was unprepared for the transition from an Arabic-based curriculum to an English-based curriculum. I had to admit that it took me more than double the effort and time compared to my peers to complete an assignment. Initially, I felt disoriented and questioned my ability to continue my education.
On the other hand, my physics professor was a kindred spirit. He was also born in Lebanon, and his relocation to California was motivated by both financial concerns and a desire to further his education. To improve my listening and English skills, he suggested I read and watch certain books and television programs. He highlighted how this helped him overcome his language barrier.
I resolved to improve my English using his methods; I read The Best of Me by Nicholas Sparks and watched
"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" to familiarize myselt with common English vocabularies. Gradually, | became more at ease with reading difficult passages and listening to fast-paced lectures. To further enhance my English skills, I also took English classes. Professors instructed me on how to approach writing papers as an opportunity to further explore and enjoy a topic, as opposed to a dreaded chore. I used to conduct additional research and watch YouTube videos for each essay topic that I had to write about. This increased my enjoyment of the English language while enhancing my listening and writing skills.
Despite the fact that I attribute my English progress to my hard work, I also credit my progress to my professors who provided invaluable advice. I began to enjoy the English language as I began to converse,
watch movies. read books and articles in the
language. After continuous dedication and hard work, I am proud of my ability to adapt to an English-based curriculum and pursue my educational journey.
