Math has always been a subject that has attracted me since elementary school. I was first introduced to a math problem back in the 1st grade. At first it was tough, like anything new you learn you have to practice it over and over again to get good at it. As I started to understand math and was introduced to multiplication and division it started to get fun for me. I still remember during my 3rd grade class we would do timed multiplication problems and I enjoyed them. I would always try my best to be the fastest and get the best grade in my class. Fortunately, nearly all the time I would accomplish my goal of finishing first and getting the best grade. 

 

In school I have always heard the phrase that “you will need this in the outside world”. This phrase has been true to say the least when it comes to math. In a business you need to be able to add,subtract,multiply, and divide. As a person who has been involved in a business which flips shoes as a co-owner I have had to use my knowledge in math at times in order to see my profit margins and if it’s worth spending x amount to make x amount of money. 

 

My interest in math has always been there since I was a kid. As I have grown up and am now in High School it has gotten a bit tougher as the equations and formulas require a lot more thinking. Thankfully, I still find joy in doing math although I sometimes fail to understand the work and can get frustrated by it as my grade suffers. I know how important math is as we use numbers on a daily basis. I will continue to admire it no matter how difficult and frustrating it may get for me as I still remember that kid who loved doing math problems and enjoyed it like a fun video game.
