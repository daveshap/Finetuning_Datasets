ESSAY: I was born and raised in the south, so I've always been a bit of a rebel. I always questioned things that didn't make sense to me, and I never took anything at face value. This tendency to question things led me to challenge a lot of beliefs and ideas that I was raised with. One of the biggest beliefs that I challenged was the idea that women should be submissive to men.

I was always a strong-willed person, and I never liked the idea of being told what to do. I always saw my mom and grandmothers as independent women who didn't need a man to take care of them. So, when I was told that I needed to be submissive to my husband, I started to question why. I began to read about feminism and women's rights, and I realized that I didn't have to be submissive to anyone.

This was a big turning point for me, and it led me to challenge a lot of other ideas that I was raised with. I realized that I didn't have to blindly accept everything that I was told, and that I could start thinking for myself. This was a huge realization for me, and it completely changed the way that I saw the world.
