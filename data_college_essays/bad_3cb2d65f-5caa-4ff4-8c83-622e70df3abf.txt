ESSAY: I remember when I was younger, I used to believe that the world was a really scary place. I thought that there were monsters under my bed and that I would never be able to go outside and play by myself. I was always afraid of the dark, and I would have these terrible nightmares that would keep me up at night. But then one day, I decided to challenge that belief. I realized that if I was never going to go outside and play by myself, then I would never be able to experience all the great things that the world has to offer. So I gathered up my courage and went outside, and I haven't been scared of the dark since.

Now, I know that the world isn't nearly as scary as I thought it was when I was younger. questioning and Challenging my beliefs has led me to a much better understanding of the world and has helped me to become a braver person. I'm grateful that I was able to overcome my fears and see the world for what it really is.
