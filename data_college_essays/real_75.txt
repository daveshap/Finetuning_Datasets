Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—get to know you better.

 

Salutations future roommate!

 

First things first, interests. Food will always be a first love, but more than eating, I love cooking and sharing my unique cultures through cuisine. As a broke college student, I plan to save money and cook meals for myself. You can always count on me to save you a plate (if you want)! However, good health is only achieved with a good diet and exercise. Being vertically challenged, I enjoy lifting weights and building strength to make up for my height. Although I can't reach the top shelf, I can most definitely give you a boost!

One word I would use to characterize myself is contradictory. My room can be a complete mess when my life is in the most organized state. Though my side of the dorm may look like a fire hazard, I assure you that there’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place! If you ever need a clean pair of socks, you can always grab one from the mound of them in the corner. However, my interior decorating skills are unfortunately limited to post-it notes scattered across the walls filled with frantically handwritten notes and diagrams. I like to pace around while I study, but if it bothers you at any time, please let me know. As your living partner, I want to be considerate of your wants and needs.

 

I can’t wait to know you better and I hope we can form a lasting bond!

 

Best,

Mia Kamisato
