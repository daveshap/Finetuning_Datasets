ESSAY: There are lots of things that are interesting to me and that I enjoy learning about. I getparticularly engrossed, though, when I'm learning about things that I can apply to my own life. I find these topics much more engaging than simply acquiring knowledge for its own sake.

I find it fascinating to learn about the different psychological disorders andwhat causes them. I also enjoy learning about different types of therapy and how they can help people.

I have found that I can learn a lot by talking to people who have first-hand experience with mental disorders and therapy. Overall, I find psychology to be a very engaging and beneficial subject.
