ESSAY: When I was younger, I used to always believe that I had to be the best at everything I did. Whether it was sports, school or just life in general, I always felt like I had to be number one. However, there was one particular moment in my life when I realized that this mindset was not only unsustainable, but also incredibly unhealthy.

It was during my sophomore year of high school when I ran for class president. I had been involved in student government since I was in elementary school and I had always been passionate about making my school a better place. So, when it came time to run for office, I went all out. I put up posters, made speeches and really tried to get the vote.

But, when the ballots were tallied, I lost. I was devastated. I couldn't understand how all of my hard work had gone to waste. But, as I started to accept defeat, I realized that losing wasn't the end of the world. In fact, it was actually a pretty valuable experience.

Through losing, I learned that I couldn't always be the best and that was okay. I learned that sometimes you have to lose in order to learn and grow. And, most importantly, I learned that it was okay to be imperfect.

So, while at first glance, losing the election may have seemed like a negative experience, it was actually one of the most valuable lessons I've ever learned. It taught me that it's okay to fail, as long as you learn from it. And, for that, I am incredibly grateful.
