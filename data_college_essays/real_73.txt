When I study math, I use my creativity, especially when dealing with complex algebra, derivatives, or functions. Since I was young, I have enjoyed honing the focus and attention to detail that complex math problems demand, challenging myself to avoid any minor errors. I have a knack for working with numbers and solving them. I would make a "Kahoot" game with timed questions before each exam and quiz in order to genuinely advance my math skills.
This technique greatly helped me approach math as a fun puzzle rather than a stressor by simulating the exam and practicing being acutely aware of any minor errors in these timed questions. Exams were much easier for me once I developed this strategy, and I started to look forward to them rather than dread them. I could never have predicted this outcome in the beginning. I have now started applying this game-like strategy to my other courses
as well and I have seen a remarkable improvement in both my grades and my confidence in my ability to
earn
Now that I work as a private tutor for the company
"Grade Potential," I impart this knowledge and enthusiasm to my students. I am very pleased with not only the progress of my students' in their math scores but also how they are enjoying math sessions with me using my creative game-like approach. So, made the decision to use social media sites like Reddit and Discord to further share my creative strategy of learning math. I motivate everyone to play this kahoot game repeatedly until they are able to complete it without making a mistake. I firmly
believe that everyone can do this and
simultaneously get better at math while also enjoying it. Since many students often view math as a difficult subject, my goal is to dispel this myth by sharing the creative method of learning calculus.
