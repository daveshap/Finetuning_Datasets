The rich sound of traditional Sinhala music fills the air and mingled with the suave Bengali words my dad speaks on the phone. I feel my mom run her hands through my long black hair, applying coconut oil to aid in its growth, much like my grandmother did to her when she was my age. The smell of aromatic spices fills the air from a steaming tray of malu pan, a Sri Lankan dish that translates to 'fish bread'. This is the comforting scene that my parents created- where not two, but three different cultures (Sri Lankan, Bengali, and Western) could coexist together. 

When starting high school, the lack of diversity quickly became apparent- not only was I one of the few Asian students, but I was also one of the few kids with darker skin. It was the value of diversity that saved me from struggling with concepts of culture, pride, ambition, and the fear of fitting into stereotypes. 

Within the diverse environment that my parents created, I was able to find myself again. My Sri Lankan mother has emphasized the values of humility and adaptability, while my Bangladeshi dad encourages perseverance and community. Together, they share similar values of hospitality, love, and diversity. These values, among the ones I held growing up in the United States, are instilled in me and encourage me to work toward widespread diversity. I strive not only for promoting cultural appreciation and pride in heritage but also to encourage ambition no matter the stereotype. Becoming a woman in STEM will be my first step in doing this.
