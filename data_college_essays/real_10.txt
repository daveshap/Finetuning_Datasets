I finished my paper on ‘Horizon Thermodynamics’ yesterday and to say that I’m eager for today’s lecture is an understatement. It’s evocative of the feeling I experienced after submitting an article titled, ‘Escaping Black Holes’, to headline the school magazine last year.

I exit the Deepwater Horizon Collaboratory focused on mapping oil spills in the Atlantic Ocean and sprint to SSLH for my PHYS 151L lecture with Professor Vahe Peroomian. It’s 9:52 AM and I’m early. Unraveling thermodynamics, he postulates theories which I relate to concepts explored in his research papers, amplifying my fascination with physics.

Submitting my Amateur Astronomy Society proposal to Mr. Brian Stowe, I head to the Undergraduate Symposium to present my ameliorated, self-sufficient aerogarden model.

The next stop is the USCRPL where I accentuate attention on Dompiercer’s propulsion systems. Before that, I have a work lunch at Literatea with SASE for the upcoming West Regional Conference. My law background supplements my role as the Speaker of the Senate in bimonthly meetings; final commitment for the day.

Ping! Leaving for the Trojan DebSoc BPD celebratory dinner, I receive a notification confirming my selection into the Schaeffer Fellows Program for the summer, adding to the celebrations. Um, I’ll have to leave early, my article for the APDS USC is due tomorrow. I’ll see you at Taper Hall for the quiz tomorrow.

This is a typical Monday in my life at USC. A quest celebrating musing, fabrication of abstract theories and helping me palliate my eternal curiosity.
