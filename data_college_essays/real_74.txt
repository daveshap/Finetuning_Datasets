The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.

 

I was in 8th-grade life-sciences class when I first heard about bacteriophages, a.k.a small viruses that consume harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant ones. Immediately, I recognized their potential to cure sick individuals in my state, especially Native Hawaiians** living in impoverished areas. I became fascinated with them—spending hours locked in my room with my laptop, falling through internet rabbit holes about phage therapy treatments that cured nearly-dead patients.

Eventually, I exhausted all the current online resources that I could find and was forced to wait until updates were published—a break that dragged on for what seemed like an eternity. In the meantime, I decided to try contacting the authors of the papers I read to ask them my questions directly. My naive ambition also led me to find my own bacteriophages in hopes of learning how to cultivate them myself. For months, I collected samples of dirt, dead skin, and nail clippings but had no luck finding that familiar polyhedral head until, one day, it appeared like a gold key in a pile of rusty ones.

As I peered into my school’s out-of-date microscope, there it was, a fuzzy (yet distinct) phage swimming around the dish. Although there was only one bacteriophage (an insufficient amount to fight off even a minor bacterial infection), I stared in awe and realized, “This is what I’m meant to do.”

 

**Historically, Native Hawaiians are more susceptible to being immunocompromised. Many also face limited access to healthcare services and poorer economic and living conditions.
