Poster presentation was the highlight of my elementary school days. On any given subject, I was able to convert the monotonous sans-serif texts to the vision I had conjured up in my head onto the cardboard. As a visual learner, it was more helpful when there were added images or animation along with the words. Being able to present my creation felt like I was sharing a piece of myself to the world. I like to think that in addition to the materials, the visuals convey emotions that enhances the readers experience in wanting to learn more.

In community college, I stumbled upon a course called UI/UX, which stands for user interaction/user experience. I view it as the gateway between human to machines. In that class, I developed the skills of understanding and interpreting beyond what a person might need.

I was all about efficiency and catering to the need of the user. The process was elaborate and intricate all the way through the completion of the design process. It made me become hyper aware of the applications and my daily surroundings regarding the design to functionality. At the end of the course, my observant skills were sharpened. I was able to exercise my interest in design and tinker around in this new branch of design.

I realized that the principles of designing for users' experience does not only apply within the subject. There are qualities of UI/UX design principle that share similarities with the core function within the business industry. Being able to discover a correlation between my interest of design and the the world of business, opened a new approach for me.
