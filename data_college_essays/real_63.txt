I came to the U.S. from South Korea when I was 11. My dad remained in Korea to provide for my mom and me. However, he saw that his job was not sufficient to support us so he turned to stock trading full-time. However, he became more in debt and borrowed from relatives to keep us in the U.S. 

 

Due to the family’s unstable economic situation and immigration status, I felt guilty about asking my mom for anything that might be a financial burden, despite her unconditional willingness to support me. For example, I was injured while trying out for the high school soccer team, but I did not ask my mom for full treatment, as it meant she had to pay out of pocket. After graduating from high school, I was accepted to four-year colleges. However, due to my immigration status, it would have been prohibitively costly for me to attend. As a result, I took a semester off and applied to a 2-year college to be on track to get a bachelor’s degree. While attending community colleges, I tutored students to pay for the tuition and support my mom. After transferring to UC, I learned that my dad could not support my mom. With me no longer working and my mom working a minimum wage job, the economic uncertainty distracted me in the first year at UC, which resulted in the drop-off in grades.
