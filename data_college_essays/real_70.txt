Leaving Lebanon to study in the United States is the most significant challenge I have faced so far. After I moved to California to further my education, I expected that my father would financially support me. Unexpectedly, after the first month of living abroad, my dad informed me that he is no longer able to support me because his money has been frozen due to Lebanon's banks going bankrupt. This change in my life was never anticipated and I wondered where my life was destined to go.
Instead of dwelling on my problems, I resolved to get up and look for work in order to improve my financial situation. I got a full-time job at a nearby McDonald's and worked extra hours during semester break. This was my first job, and I had no idea how the environment would be. I did, however, form friendships with my coworkers and thus improved my social skills and helped me become extroverted. I became a financially independent individual and began to save as much money as I could to ensure my survival. In addition, I gave some of my remaining savings to my father and grandparents who are stuck in Lebanon.
Initially, I believed that attending college and working a full-time job simultaneously would be challenging. In order to balance my time between school and work, I improved my time management abilities. For instance, I created a weekly schedule detailing how my time should be allocated throughout the day. This helped me reevaluate how do I efficiently leave time for studying. Instead of procrastinating and wasting time, I would go to the library to review my notes after clase
Despite the challenges, I take pride in my work ethics, time management skills, and dedication, all of which contributed to my academic, social, and personal success. I must admit that initially I worried that these difficulties would interfere with my academic progress. However, persistence and
patience are essential traits for success at various
levels of life.
