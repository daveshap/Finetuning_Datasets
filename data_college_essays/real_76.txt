Clash! The sound of bowls slamming against the marble rings throughout the house, signaling my father and I that it’s dinner time. An uncomfortable tension creeps up our spines as we slowly take our seats. “She’s angry again, don’t say anything!”, we both think as we glance over to my mother throwing the last of the dishes on the table. My expertise in laughing at inappropriate times never ceases to curse me at these times as a subtle chuckle escapes my mouth. I try to hold it in but a loud guffaw comes out instead.

My mother whips in my direction.

“What.” The crease between her eyebrows hardens.

“What’s so funny?” she demands, her eyebrows raising.

“Really, what?!” A smirk starts to grow across her face as I cover mine in shame.

Suddenly, my mother starts to giggle too at the sight of my inappropriate hysteria, her laughter only growing louder. My father smiles as the tension finally breaks and we all start to relax in our seats.

This is what family dinner is for; it allows us to gather together and simply have a meal while we talk and release our stress. I always look forward to sitting down with my family after a long day and simply enjoying their presence. I deeply cherish these little moments that I have with them—however fleeting they may be—because I know that this is what I’ll remember about my parents. This moment is the definition of family.
