The University of Rochester benefactor entrepreneur, photography pioneer and philanthropist George Eastman said, “What we do during our working hours determines what we have; what we do in our leisure hours determines what we are.” Looking forward towards your college experience, what do you hope to do outside of the classroom at the University of Rochester that will enhance who you are as a person? How will specific academic and social opportunities here help you grow? (200 words)

Rochester is the best place for me to contribute to society because its strong commitment to openness and accountability perfectly aligns with my dedication to doing the same.

 

Driven to make a positive difference in the lives of underprivileged children, I tutored them in high school. I’m eager to do it again through the Partners in Reading Club to support elementary school students, foster inclusiveness, and build safe environments where differences only strengthen my community. Along with helping them, I’d like to learn from their endless curiosity and creativity.

 

In high school, I had countless opportunities to broaden my knowledge of astronomy by reading “All About Space” and “Sky&Telescope.” Through the activities at the Mees Observatory with the Astronomy Club, I hope to discuss the universe and collaborate with like-minded peers.

 

With years of experience in volleyball, I want to participate in the Women’s Volleyball Club. Sharing a similar enthusiasm with students empowers me and helps to maintain balance in my life.

 

Not only would I like to leave a mark with these clubs, but I’d also like to try new activities such as Women’s Rugby and American Sign Language. At Rochester, I know that leaving my comfort zone will allow me to improve my communication skills, collaborate with people of all backgrounds, and grow into my best self.
