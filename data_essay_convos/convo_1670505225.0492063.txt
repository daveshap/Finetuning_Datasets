STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: Great question! One way to make your essay more engaging is to use vivid language. This means using words that create a strong image in the reader's mind and help them connect to the story you're telling. You could also use anecdotes or personal stories to illustrate your points. Finally, try to make sure your essay has a clear structure and flow, so it's easy for the reader to follow.
