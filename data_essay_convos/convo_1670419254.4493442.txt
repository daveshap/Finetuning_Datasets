COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay about how science and politics are intertwined in Europe and how it affects other countries like Thailand.
COACH: That's a great topic! Can you tell me a bit more about what you want to focus on?
STUDENT: Well, I want to discuss how Europe's scientific advances have affected its political landscape, and how those effects have been felt in other parts of the world, particularly Thailand.
COACH: Interesting. Do you have any particular examples in mind?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm thinking of the way that European countries have been able to use their scientific knowledge to gain an economic advantage over other countries, such as Thailand. I also want to talk about how Europe's scientific advances have impacted the way Thailand is governed and how it has been able to develop.
COACH: That's a great angle to explore. Can you tell me a bit more about how you plan to approach this topic?
STUDENT: Sure. I was thinking of starting by discussing the history of scientific advances in Europe and how they have shaped the political landscape. Then I'd like to move on to looking at how those advances have impacted other countries, like Thailand, and how they have been able to use those advances to their advantage. Finally, I'd like to discuss how Europe's scientific advances have also had a negative impact on Thailand, and how the country has had to overcome those obstacles.
COACH: That's a great plan. Do you have any questions or worries about writing this essay?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm a bit worried about how to approach the topic of rejection and how to discuss it in a way that's respectful and not too negative.
COACH: That's a valid concern. I think the best way to approach this is to focus on the positive aspects of how Thailand has been able to use Europe's scientific advances to its advantage, while still acknowledging the difficulties and obstacles that have been faced. You could also look at the ways in which Thailand has been able to overcome those obstacles and use them to its advantage.
