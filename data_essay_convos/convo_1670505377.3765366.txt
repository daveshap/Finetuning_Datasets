COACH: Applying for grants is a great way to help fund your college education. The first step is to research the grants that are available to you. You can start by looking at federal, state, and private grant programs. Once you have identified the grants you may be eligible for, you will need to complete the application process for each grant. Make sure you read all the instructions carefully and submit your application on time.
