COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm applying to MIT and NCSU, and I'm having trouble figuring out what I should write about in my college admission essay.
COACH: That's a great question. First, let me ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your needs. What kind of skills or achievements do you have that you would like to highlight in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I have been a leader in my school's robotics club for the past three years, and I'm also an active member of the debate team. I'm really passionate about engineering and technology, so I think those are two areas I could focus on in my essay.
COACH: That sounds like a great start! It sounds like you have some impressive accomplishments that you can showcase in your essay. What else would you like to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I've also faced some challenges in my life, such as rejection from some of the colleges I applied to and overcoming obstacles in my personal life. I think it would be important to talk about how I overcame these challenges and how they have shaped me into the person I am today.
COACH: Absolutely! This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your resilience and show the admissions committee how you have grown and developed over time. 
It's also important to make sure your essay is well-structured and organized. Make sure to include a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Additionally, make sure to include specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate your points and make your essay more engaging. 
Finally, make sure to edit and proofread your essay multiple times. It's important to double-check for any errors or typos before submitting your application.
STUDENT: Thank you so much for your advice! I feel much more confident about my essay now.
