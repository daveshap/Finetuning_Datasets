COACH: Well, the best way to get scholarships and grants is to apply for them. You can find a list of scholarships and grants available by doing research online or asking your high school guidance counselor. Once you have a list of scholarships and grants that you qualify for, you should apply for them. The more you apply for, the better chance you have of receiving one. 
STUDENT: What kind of essay should I write for my college admissions essay?
COACH: An argumentative essay would be a great choice for your college admissions essay. An argumentative essay is a type of essay that presents an argument in favor of a particular point of view. It should be well-researched and supported with evidence. The essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. In the introduction, you should introduce the topic and explain why it is important. In the body paragraphs, you should present your arguments and support them with evidence. Finally, in the conclusion, you should summarize your argument and provide a call-to-action.
