COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should summarize the main points of your essay and provide a sense of closure. You want to leave the reader with a lasting impression of who you are and what you’re capable of. You can also use the conclusion to express your enthusiasm for the program or school you’re applying to. Try to end on a positive note.
