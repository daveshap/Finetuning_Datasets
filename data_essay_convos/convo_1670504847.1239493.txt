STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: One of the best ways to make your essay shorter is to focus on one specific point that you want to make in your essay. Make sure that all of your arguments and evidence are related to this point. This will help you to be concise and cut out any unnecessary information. You can also look for any words or phrases that can be replaced with shorter ones. Finally, you can look at your essay and see if there are any sentences or paragraphs that don't add much to your argument and can be removed.
