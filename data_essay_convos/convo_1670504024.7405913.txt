COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: A good essay is one that has a clear argument, is well-structured, and is supported by evidence. It should also be written in a style that is appropriate for the audience. To make sure your essay is good, you should read it through multiple times and make sure it meets the criteria above. Additionally, you can have someone else read it to get an outside opinion.
