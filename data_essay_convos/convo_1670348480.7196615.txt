COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm applying to Duke University. I want to write an essay about my experiences growing up in Vietnam and how it has shaped my views on social issues.
COACH: That's a great topic for your essay! Can you tell me a bit more about your background? What are some of the social issues that you feel strongly about?
STUDENT: Well, growing up in Vietnam, I saw a lot of poverty and inequality. I think it's important to make sure everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. I also feel strongly about education and making sure that everyone has the chance to get an education no matter their background.
COACH: Those are both very important issues. How have your experiences in Vietnam shaped your views on these issues?
STUDENT: Growing up in Vietnam, I saw firsthand how poverty and inequality can affect people's lives. I saw how people struggled to get basic necessities and how lack of education can hold people back. It made me realize how important it is to help those who are less fortunate and to make sure everyone has equal opportunities.
COACH: That's a powerful realization. How have you taken action to help those in need?
STUDENT: I've been involved in several charity projects in Vietnam, helping to provide basic necessities to those in need. I've also been involved in educational programs in my community, helping to provide resources and support to students from low-income families.
