COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: Well, that's a great question. There are several ways to approach this. First, let's talk about what kind of essay you're writing. Is it a grant application?
STUDENT: Yes, it is.
COACH: Okay, great. The most important thing to remember when writing a grant application is to make sure that your essay is clear and concise. You want to make sure that the reader understands your points quickly and easily. Once you have written your essay, you should go back and read it over several times to make sure that all of your points are clear. Additionally, you should have someone else read it over to ensure that they understand it as well. Once you have done this, you can feel confident that your essay is finished.
