COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay for college admissions and I'm not sure what admissions officers look for.
COACH: That's a great question! Admissions officers typically look for essays that demonstrate a student's ability to think critically, write clearly, and make connections between their experiences and the topics they are exploring. It's also important to show your passion for the topic and your enthusiasm for learning.
STUDENT: Okay, that's helpful. I'm from the Philippines and I'm interested in writing about my volunteer work there. What kind of essay structure should I use?
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! When it comes to essay structure, it's important to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. In the introduction, you should introduce the topic and provide some context for why it is important to you. The body should include specific examples and anecdotes that illustrate your point. Finally, the conclusion should provide a summary of your main points and explain why this topic is important to you.
STUDENT: Got it. I'm also a Christian and I want to talk about how that faith has shaped my life. How can I make sure the essay isn't too preachy?
COACH: That's a great question! When writing about your faith, it's important to focus on how it has impacted your life and your decisions rather than advocating for any particular belief. It's also important to remember that your essay should be about you and your experiences, so try to avoid making broad generalizations about Christianity or any other religion.
