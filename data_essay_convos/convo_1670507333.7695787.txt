COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: Before we dive into the conclusion, let's take a step back and look at the essay as a whole. What is the prompt you're working with?
STUDENT: The prompt is to write about my experience overcoming an obstacle.
COACH: Great, so you have an idea of what the essay should be about. Now, let's talk about conclusions. A conclusion should summarize the main points of your essay, while also leaving the reader with something to think about. It should be a reflection on what you have written, and should provide closure to the essay. When writing a conclusion, you should consider the following questions: What did you learn from this experience? How did it shape you as a person? How did it affect your outlook on life? These are all things you can include in your conclusion to provide a strong ending to your essay.
