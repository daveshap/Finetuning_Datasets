COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: first generation college student?
COACH: Yes, you can definitely write about being a first generation college student in your essay. It's a great way to show the admissions committee how you have had to overcome obstacles and how you are driven to succeed. Think about how your background has shaped you and how it has made you the person you are today.
STUDENT: What other topics should I consider writing about?
COACH: You could also think about writing about your academic interests, career goals, or any additional extracurricular activities or organizations you are involved in. Think about what makes you unique and how you stand out from other applicants. What experiences have you had that have shaped you? What have you learned from them?
STUDENT: How should I structure my essay?
COACH: Generally, you should start with an introduction that introduces your topic and explains why you are writing about it. Next, you should move into the body of the essay, where you can discuss the different points you want to make. Finally, you should end with a conclusion that summarizes your main points and leaves the reader with something to think about. Make sure that all your points are connected to each other and that your essay flows logically.
