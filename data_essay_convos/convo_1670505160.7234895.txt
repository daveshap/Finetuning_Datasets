COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: Well, the best way to make your essay engaging is to focus on telling a story. You want to draw the reader in with vivid details and a narrative arc that will keep them interested. Think of it like a mini-movie, where you are the protagonist and you are trying to overcome some kind of obstacle. Make sure to include moments of conflict and resolution so that the reader can connect with your journey. 
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: You should focus on the main points that you want to make about yourself and why you are a great candidate for law school. Think about your unique experiences and how they have shaped you into the person you are today. You should also include any special skills or talents that you possess that would make you an asset to the law school. Finally, be sure to explain why you are passionate about pursuing a career in law and why you think you would excel in the field.
