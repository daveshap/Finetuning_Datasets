COACH: That's a great question! Are you writing a dissertation?
STUDENT: Yes, I am.
COACH: Okay, great. When it comes to structuring a dissertation, there are a few key elements you should keep in mind. First, you'll need a clear introduction that outlines the purpose of your essay and sets the tone for the rest of the paper. Next, you'll need a body section that contains your main arguments and evidence to support them. Finally, you'll need a conclusion that summarizes the main points of your essay and ties everything together.
