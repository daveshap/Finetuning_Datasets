COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what if i get rejected?
COACH: That's a great question. It's important to remember that the admissions process is highly competitive, and not everyone who applies will be accepted. That said, you can increase your chances of acceptance by writing a compelling essay that demonstrates your unique skills, experiences, and perspectives. To do this, you'll want to focus on telling a story that highlights your strengths and accomplishments. It's also important to proofread your essay for any errors or typos, as these can make a bad impression on the admissions committee. Finally, make sure to follow all instructions given by the college when submitting your essay.
