COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for help with my college applications. I'm applying to Yale and NCSU and I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with topics for my essays.
COACH: That's understandable. It can be difficult to come up with ideas, especially when you're applying to two different schools. What kind of topics have you been considering?
STUDENT: I have no idea what to write about. I've been thinking about writing about my experiences in high school, but I'm not sure if that would be interesting enough.
COACH: That's a great place to start. Your high school experiences can provide a lot of insight into who you are and what you value. Think about any challenges you faced, or successes you achieved, and how they shaped your outlook on life. Also, think about any special skills or talents you have that you can highlight in your essay.
STUDENT: That's a great idea. I think I can come up with some good topics now. But I'm also worried about what I'm going to do after college. How do I find a job?
COACH: Finding a job after college is a common concern for many students. The best way to prepare is to start building your network now. Talk to people in your field of interest, attend events and workshops related to your career goals, and use social media to connect with potential employers. You can also start looking for internships and volunteering opportunities that can help you gain experience and build your resume. Additionally, research graduate programs and consider applying to one if it's the right fit for you.
