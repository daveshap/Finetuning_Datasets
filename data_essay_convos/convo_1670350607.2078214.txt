COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Yale and I'm trying to write an essay about my experiences as a Muslim from a poor family who is also neurodiverse.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic! Before we dive into your essay, can you tell me a bit more about yourself and your background?
STUDENT: Sure! I'm originally from China and moved to the US when I was 10. I come from a very poor family and most of my relatives still live in China. I'm also Muslim and have struggled with neurodiversity since I was a child.
COACH: Thank you for sharing that with me. I can see why this topic would be important to you. What inspired you to write about it?
STUDENT: Well, I think it's important to talk about these issues because they're often overlooked or misunderstood. I want to show people that even though I come from a disadvantaged background, I can still achieve success.
COACH: That's a great goal! Can you tell me more about how you plan to approach this essay?
STUDENT: I want to focus on how my faith and my neurodiversity have both been a source of strength and resilience for me. I want to highlight how I've been able to overcome challenges and use them as motivation to reach my goals.
COACH: That's a great angle for your essay. Do you have any specific examples or stories that you want to include?
STUDENT: Yes, I want to talk about how my faith has helped me stay grounded and focused despite the difficulties I've faced. I also want to discuss how my neurodiversity has allowed me to approach problems in different ways and find creative solutions.
COACH: Those are great ideas! Is there anything else you'd like to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Yes, I want to talk about how my family has supported me throughout my journey. Even though we don't have much, they have always been there for me and encouraged me to pursue my dreams.
COACH: That's wonderful! It sounds like you have a lot of great material to work with. Is there anything else I can help you with?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts and putting them into words. Do you have any advice for me?
COACH: Absolutely! The best way to organize your thoughts is to create an outline of your essay. Start by writing down the main points you want to make and then break them down into smaller ideas. Once you have an outline, you can begin to write your essay.
