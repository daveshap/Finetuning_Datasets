STUDENT: how do grants work?
COACH: Grants are financial awards given to students to help pay for college. Generally, grants are need-based awards and may come from the federal government, state government, colleges and universities, or private organizations. To be eligible for a grant, you must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet certain criteria set by the granting organization. The amount of money you receive can vary depending on the type of grant and your financial situation.
