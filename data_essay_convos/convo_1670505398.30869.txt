COACH: A personal statement for grad school should include your academic and professional background, your goals for the future, and why you think you would be a good fit for the program you are applying to. It should also explain how the program will help you reach your goals. Make sure to include any relevant experiences or achievements that can demonstrate your commitment to the field you are applying to.
