COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: I'm applying to law school, and I want to write an essay that really stands out.
COACH: That's great! What kind of unique experiences or perspectives do you think you could bring to the essay?
STUDENT: Well, I'm part of the LGBT community and I'm passionate about advocating for LGBT rights. I also have a strong interest in creativity and art, and I've been involved in volunteer work for several years.
COACH: That's wonderful! Have you ever faced any challenges or obstacles related to your LGBT identity or your creative pursuits?
STUDENT: Yes, definitely. I've faced a lot of rejection when it comes to my creative work, and I've had to overcome those rejections and keep pushing forward.
COACH: That's really inspiring! How have you used those experiences to inform your approach to advocacy and volunteer work?
STUDENT: I think it's made me more resilient and determined to make a difference. It's also taught me to be more open-minded and understanding of different perspectives. I think this has been a great asset when it comes to my advocacy and volunteer work.
COACH: That's great! Can you think of any specific examples where you've used your experiences to make a positive impact?
STUDENT: Sure. I recently volunteered with an LGBT youth organization, and I was able to use my own experiences to help young people understand their own identities and how to navigate the world as an LGBT person. I also created a series of art installations to raise awareness about LGBT issues, and I was able to use my creative skills to get the message across.
COACH: That sounds like a really powerful way to use your experiences. Do you think these experiences will help you in law school?
STUDENT: Absolutely. My experiences have taught me how to think critically and analytically, which are both essential skills for a successful law career. I also think my understanding of different perspectives and my resilience will be very helpful in law school.
