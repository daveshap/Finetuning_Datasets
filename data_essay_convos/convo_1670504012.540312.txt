COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question! The best way to know if your essay is good is to have someone else read it and give you honest feedback. That could be a friend, family member, teacher, or even a professional essay coach. You want to make sure that the person giving you feedback is knowledgeable about the college admissions process.
Another way to evaluate your essay is to ask yourself if it is clear, concise, and compelling. Does it tell a story that conveys your personality and values? Does it emphasize your strengths and show why you would be a great fit for the college?
Finally, make sure that you proofread your essay for grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. A well-written essay can be ruined by careless errors.
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: This will depend on the prompt that you are given, but generally you want to focus on your strengths, experiences, and values. Think about what makes you unique and how you can convey that through your story.
You also want to make sure that your essay is focused. Make sure that each paragraph has a clear point and supports your overall theme.
Finally, don't forget to be creative! Your essay should be engaging and memorable. Try to use vivid language and imagery to make your essay stand out.
