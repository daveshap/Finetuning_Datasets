COACH: That's a great question. Applying for grants is a great way to pay for college. The first step is to research the different types of grants available and find out which ones you may qualify for. You can usually find this information on the collegeâ€™s website or in the college's financial aid office. Once you have identified the grants you want to apply for, you will need to fill out an application form. Make sure to provide accurate information and follow all instructions carefully. After submitting the application, you may need to provide additional documentation to prove your eligibility. 
STUDENT: What should I include in my argumentative essay?
COACH: When writing an argumentative essay, it's important to make sure that your argument is clear and well-supported. Start by introducing the topic and providing some background information. Then, state your argument clearly and provide evidence to support it. Your evidence could come from research, personal experience, or other sources. Be sure to explain how your evidence supports your argument. Finally, provide a conclusion that summarizes your argument and reiterates your main points.
