COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: Great question! There are a few ways to make your essay shorter without sacrificing the quality of your writing. First, you can look for places where you can condense your ideas into fewer words. For example, if you have a sentence that has three ideas in it, you can try to break them up into two separate sentences. Additionally, you can look for phrases or words that can be removed without changing the meaning of your sentence. Lastly, you can look for any unnecessary details and delete them.
