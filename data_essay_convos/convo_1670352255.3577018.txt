COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to the University of North Carolina and I'm a bit overwhelmed by the essay component of my application. I'm not sure why it matters so much or what the admissions officers are looking for.
COACH: That's a great question. An essay is an important part of the application process because it gives admissions officers a chance to get to know you beyond your grades and test scores. It's an opportunity for you to show them who you are and what makes you unique. Admissions officers look for essays that demonstrate your knowledge, creativity, and passion for the subject. They also want to see how you think and communicate, as well as how you handle difficult topics.
STUDENT: I understand that, but I'm a bit nervous about revealing my neurodiversity in my essay. I worry that it could hurt my chances of getting accepted.
COACH: That's a valid concern, but it's important to remember that admissions officers want to get to know the real you. It's ok to be honest about your neurodiversity and how it has shaped your life and your perspective. You can use your essay to show how you have overcome obstacles and how your neurodiversity has made you a better person. It can also be a great way to highlight your resilience and determination.
