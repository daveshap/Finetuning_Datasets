STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Harvard and Princeton, and I need help with my essay. 
COACH: That's great! What kind of essay are you writing?
STUDENT: I'm writing about my volunteer work and how it has shaped me as a person.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! Could you tell me a bit more about your volunteer work? What have you done and what have you learned from it?
STUDENT: Sure. I've been volunteering at a soup kitchen for the past year, and it's really opened my eyes to the struggles of poverty. I've learned so much about empathy and compassion, and it's made me a better person.
COACH: That's wonderful! It sounds like you've gained a lot of valuable insight from your volunteer work. Have you thought about how you can incorporate this into your essay?

COACH: That's a great idea! What other points do you want to make in your essay?
STUDENT: I also want to discuss how my experience has helped me understand issues like sexism and inequality.
COACH: That's an important issue to address in your essay. Can you tell me more about how your experience has informed your views on sexism and inequality?
STUDENT: Sure. I've seen firsthand how women are often undervalued and treated unfairly. I think this has really shaped my views on gender equality and inspired me to fight for justice.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of valuable insight to share in your essay. Is there anything else you would like to discuss in your essay?
STUDENT: I'd also like to talk about how my experience has prepared me for life after college.
