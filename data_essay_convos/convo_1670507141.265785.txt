COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: i have no idea what to write about
COACH: That's okay. Let's start with a reference interview. What subject or topic are you interested in writing about?
STUDENT: I'm interested in writing about the effects of technology on society.
COACH: Great, that's a great topic to write about. Now, what kind of essay are you writing?
STUDENT: A monograph.
COACH: Alright, so for a monograph essay you'll need to provide an in-depth analysis of a single topic. You'll need to research the topic thoroughly, and then present your findings in an organized way. To start, you'll need to come up with a thesis statement that will focus your essay and provide structure. Do you have any ideas for a thesis statement?
