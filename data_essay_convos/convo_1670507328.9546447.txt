COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: Well, the conclusion of an essay is your last chance to make a lasting impression on the reader. It should be a strong and concise summary of the main points of your essay, as well as a call to action or a reflection on the topic. When writing your conclusion, you want to make sure it is clear, specific, and draws on the points you made in your essay. You can also use it to provide a broader context for your topic, or to draw attention to implications for future research.
