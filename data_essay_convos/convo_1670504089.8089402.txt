COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: Well, the best way to know when your essay is finished is to have someone else read it and give you feedback. That will help you determine if there are any changes that need to be made. It's also important to make sure that your essay is free of any errors and that it flows well. Once you feel that you have addressed all of these points, then your essay is likely finished.
