COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admission essay is an important part of the college application process because it gives the admissions committee a better understanding of who you are and why you should be accepted into their program. It also provides an opportunity for you to showcase your writing skills and demonstrate why you are a good fit for the school. It can make or break your chances of being accepted, so itâ€™s important to take it seriously.
