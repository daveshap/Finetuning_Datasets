COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm applying to medical school and I need help with my essay.
COACH: Great! Can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What do you like to do, and what are your passions?
STUDENT: Well, I'm a Christian and I love to travel. I've been to Germany a few times and really enjoyed it. I also like to read and write, but I'm not sure if I'm interesting enough for a med school essay.
COACH: That sounds like a great start! You don't have to be an incredible person to be accepted into medical school. In fact, many med schools are looking for people who demonstrate a commitment to service and a strong work ethic. How have you demonstrated those qualities in your life?
STUDENT: I volunteer at a local hospital, and I'm a part of a church group that works with the homeless. I also work hard in my classes and have good grades.
COACH: That's great! Those are all excellent examples of how you demonstrate a commitment to service and a strong work ethic. Now, let's talk about your essay. What would you like to focus on?
STUDENT: I think I'd like to focus on my experiences in Germany, and how they have shaped my views on medicine and healthcare.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! What specifically do you want to focus on? Do you want to talk about the cultural differences you experienced, the different healthcare systems you saw, or something else?
STUDENT: I think I'd like to focus on the cultural differences and how they have impacted my views on healthcare.
COACH: That's a great topic! Let's start by talking about what you observed in Germany. What were some of the cultural differences you noticed?
