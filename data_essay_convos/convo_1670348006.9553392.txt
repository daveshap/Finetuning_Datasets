COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I am applying to med school and I'm having trouble writing my essay. I'm not sure what admissions officers are looking for and what I should include in my essay.
COACH: That's a great question! The essay is your chance to show admissions officers who you are and why you would make a great addition to their program. It's important to highlight your skills and achievements in order to stand out and make a good impression. What kind of skills and achievements do you think you could include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I'm not sure. I'm not very interesting as a person, so I don't have any amazing accomplishments to talk about.
COACH: Don't worry, you don't need to have amazing accomplishments to write an effective essay. You could focus on the process of how you achieved something, even if the result wasn't extraordinary. For example, if you worked hard to achieve a good grade in a challenging course, you could talk about how you used your time management skills and determination to succeed. Or if you volunteered at a local hospital, you could talk about the impact that experience had on you and how it shaped your desire to pursue a career in medicine.
Also, you don't need to limit yourself to talking about academic or professional experiences. You can also talk about your hobbies, interests, and personal values. For example, if you are passionate about helping others, you could talk about how that motivates you to pursue a career in medicine and how it will help you be a better doctor.
Finally, if you're applying to MIT, you could also mention any unique experiences or challenges you faced that have helped you develop the skills and qualities that make you an excellent candidate. 
I hope this helps! Is there anything else I can help you with?
