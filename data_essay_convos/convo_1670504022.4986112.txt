COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question! A good essay should have a clear purpose and a strong argument. It should also have a logical structure and be well-written. You should also make sure that it is original and that it follows the guidelines of the college admissions essay.
