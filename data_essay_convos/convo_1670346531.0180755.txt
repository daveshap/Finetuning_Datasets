COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UNC and I'm having trouble with my college admission essay. I don't know what to write about or what admissions officers look for.
COACH: That's a great question! The admissions essay is an important part of the application process, as it helps the officers get to know you better. It's your chance to show them who you are, and why you would be a great addition to their student body. What kind of topics have you considered writing about?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I was thinking about writing about my volunteer work, but I'm not sure if that's too clich√©.
COACH: Absolutely not! In fact, talking about your volunteer work is a great way to demonstrate your commitment to helping others and your dedication to making a difference in your community. It also shows that you are well-rounded and have a strong sense of social responsibility. 
That said, it's important to make sure your essay is unique and stands out from the crowd. You can do this by focusing on specific experiences or moments that you remember from your volunteer work. Try to go beyond the surface level and really delve into the details of why it mattered to you and what it taught you.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I think I can definitely use that as a starting point for my essay. Is there anything else I should keep in mind when I'm writing my essay?
COACH: Definitely! Make sure that you're being honest and genuine in your essay. Admissions officers want to get a sense of who you are as a person and what makes you unique. Additionally, they want to see that you have a good command of the English language, so make sure your essay is free of grammar and spelling errors. Finally, make sure you proofread your essay multiple times before submitting it. Good luck!
