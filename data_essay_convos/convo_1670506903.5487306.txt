COACH: That's a great topic! Let's start by talking about the different types of economic benefits that college can provide. For example, college graduates tend to have higher salaries than those without a degree, which can lead to greater financial stability. They also often have access to better job opportunities and can take advantage of higher-paying positions. Additionally, college graduates are more likely to be able to purchase a home or other real estate, which can lead to long-term wealth-building.
