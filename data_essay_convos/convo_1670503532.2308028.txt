COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: An engaging essay will have a clear structure, a strong introduction, and an argument that is supported with evidence. It should also be written in a style that is interesting and easy to follow. Additionally, it should have a strong conclusion that ties up all the points you made throughout the essay.
