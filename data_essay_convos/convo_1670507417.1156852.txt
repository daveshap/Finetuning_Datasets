COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: Thatâ€™s a great question. To write a good introduction, you need to start by understanding the purpose of your essay. What are you trying to accomplish with this essay?
STUDENT: I'm trying to get into college
COACH: Okay, so you're writing an admissions essay. That means you need to focus on what makes you unique and why you would be a great addition to the college. You want to make sure that your essay stands out and captures the attention of the admissions committee.
One way to start your essay is to use a hook. This is a sentence or two that grabs the reader's attention and makes them interested in reading more. It could be a quote, a statistic, a personal story, or something else that is relevant to your essay topic.
Once you have your hook, you can introduce yourself and explain why you are writing the essay. You can talk about your background and experiences, and how they have shaped you into the person you are today. Finally, you can explain why you are a great fit for the college and why you would be an asset to their student body.
Good luck!
