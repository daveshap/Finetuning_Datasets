STUDENT: why does college matter?
COACH: College matters because it gives you the opportunity to learn and grow in a variety of ways. It can open doors to new career paths, give you access to a larger network of people, and help you develop skills to use in your future. College also allows you to explore different interests and gain knowledge that can be applied in the real world.
