COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does college matter?
COACH: College matters because it is an opportunity to expand your knowledge and gain valuable skills in a variety of areas. College also provides access to resources, such as professors and career advisors, that can help you find the right path for you. Additionally, college can open doors to internships and job opportunities that may not be available to you without a college degree.
