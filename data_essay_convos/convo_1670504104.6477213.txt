COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: A good rule of thumb is to read your essay out loud and see if it makes sense. If it does, then you are done. Another way to know when your essay is finished is to make sure that you have answered the prompt fully and that all of your arguments are supported by evidence. Finally, make sure that your essay is free from spelling and grammar errors.
