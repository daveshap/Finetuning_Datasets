COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for some advice on how to write a college application essay.
COACH: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me a bit more about your goals and personal objectives?
STUDENT: Well, I'm hoping to study in France and I want to apply to a few universities there. I'm not sure how the college admission process works in France, so I'm looking for some guidance.
COACH: That's great! The college admission process in France is similar to the process here in the US. You'll need to submit an application that includes your academic transcripts, a personal essay, and a letter of recommendation. You may also need to provide additional documents such as proof of language proficiency or proof of charity work.
Once you've gathered all the necessary documents, you can submit your application to the universities you're interested in. Make sure to read the application instructions carefully and follow all the requirements.
Now, let's talk about your personal essay. This is your chance to showcase your unique talents and experiences, so make sure to put your best foot forward. Think about what makes you stand out from other applicants and highlight those qualities in your essay.
STUDENT: That's great advice. I'm not sure how to approach writing the essay though. Do you have any tips for getting started?
COACH: Absolutely! My best advice is to start by brainstorming ideas. Think about what makes you unique and what experiences have shaped your life. Once you have a few ideas, start writing down your thoughts and create an outline of your essay. This will help you organize your thoughts and structure your essay.
Once you have your outline, start writing your essay. Focus on conveying your message clearly and concisely. Make sure to proofread your essay and have someone else read it over before submitting it.
Good luck!
