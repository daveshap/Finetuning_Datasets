COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what if i get rejected?
COACH: Rejection is a part of life, but it doesn't have to be the end of your journey. It's important to remember that there are many different paths to success and that rejection can actually help you grow and learn. Focus on writing an essay that showcases your strengths and accomplishments. Make sure to include details that will make your essay stand out from the competition. Also, remember that admissions officers are looking for applicants who are passionate about their interests and have a clear vision for the future. 
STUDENT: What kind of structure should I use?
COACH: A persuasive essay should follow the classic five-paragraph structure, with an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction should provide an overview of your topic and an explanation of why it's important. The body paragraphs should each focus on one key point that supports your argument. Finally, the conclusion should summarize your argument and reiterate why it matters.
