COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm currently writing an essay for a college application and I'm having trouble making it engaging.
COACH: That's a great question. When writing an essay, it's important to make sure that your essay stands out from the other applicants. One way to do this is to make sure that you include unique experiences or stories in your essay. For example, if you've done any volunteer work or participated in any extracurricular activities, these can be great ways to make your essay more engaging.
STUDENT: I have done some volunteer work, but I'm not sure how to incorporate it into my essay.
COACH: That's a great start! When incorporating your volunteer experience into your essay, it's important to make sure that you focus on how it has helped shape you as a person, and how it has led you to where you are today. You can also talk about what you learned from the experience and how it has impacted your goals for the future.
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. But I'm also worried about finding a job after college.
COACH: That's a common concern for many college students. When it comes to finding a job after college, there are a few things that you can do. First, make sure that you explore all of your options. Look into internships, part-time jobs, and even volunteer opportunities. You can also look into networking with professionals in your field or attending career fairs in your area. Additionally, if you're interested in law school or politics, you can look into internships or volunteer opportunities related to those fields.
