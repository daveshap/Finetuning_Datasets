COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for some advice on how to make my essay stand out. I'm not a particularly interesting person and I'm worried that my essay won't be good enough to get me into college.
COACH: That's a great question! Before we dive into the specifics of your essay, let's talk a bit about you and the things that make you unique. What are some of your interests and passions?
STUDENT: Well, I'm really passionate about LGBT rights and I've been involved in some charity work in France. I'm also interested in learning more about French culture and history.
COACH: That sounds like a great starting point! It's always helpful to draw on your own experiences and interests when writing an essay. How have these experiences shaped your perspective on life and influenced your goals for the future?
STUDENT: Well, I think that my experiences with charity work have made me more aware of the injustices that exist in the world and it's motivated me to pursue a career that will help make a difference. I also think that learning more about French culture and history has given me a better understanding of the world and how different cultures interact with one another.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of passion and drive, which is essential for any successful essay. Now, let's talk about scholarships and grants. Do you know what types of scholarships and grants are available to you?
STUDENT: Not really. I know there are a few based on financial need, but I'm not sure what else is out there.
COACH: There are actually many different types of scholarships and grants available, depending on your interests and background. For example, if you're interested in LGBT rights, there may be specific scholarships or grants available for students who are actively involved in the cause. Additionally, if you have a strong academic record, you may be eligible for merit-based scholarships or grants. Have you looked into any of these options yet?
