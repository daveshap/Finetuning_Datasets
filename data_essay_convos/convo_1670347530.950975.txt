COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay for Harvard and I'm not sure what admissions officers look for.
COACH: That's a great question! Admissions officers are looking for students who demonstrate a commitment to learning, have a strong academic background, and can contribute to the university community. They also want to know that you are passionate about something, whether it be a particular field of study, a hobby, or a social issue. 
STUDENT: I'm interested in Judaism and social issues. How can I use this in my essay?
COACH: You can definitely use your interests in Judaism and social issues in your essay. You can talk about how your experiences with Judaism have shaped your understanding of social issues and how you plan to use your knowledge to help others. You can also discuss how your faith has helped you develop critical thinking skills and how you plan to apply those skills to your studies at Harvard. Additionally, you can talk about how your faith has motivated you to take action on important social issues. This will demonstrate to admissions officers that you are passionate about something and that you are determined to make a difference in the world. 
STUDENT: That sounds great! Is there anything else I should consider when writing my essay?
COACH: Yes, absolutely! You should also consider discussing how you plan to use your Harvard education to help you find a job after college. Talk about the specific skills you plan to learn and the career paths you are interested in pursuing. This will show admissions officers that you have a clear idea of how you will use your education to benefit yourself and the world. Good luck with your essay!
