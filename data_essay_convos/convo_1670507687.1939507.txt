COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question. Let's start by talking about what your essay is about and what you want to achieve with it. What is the topic of your essay?
STUDENT: My essay is about the impact of technology on society.
COACH: Okay, so you want to explore how technology has changed the way people live and interact with each other. That's an interesting topic. What kind of research have you done so far?
STUDENT: I've been researching the history of technology and its effects on society. I've also been looking into current trends and how they are shaping our lives.
COACH: That's great. Now, let's talk about your thesis statement. What is your main argument or point that you want to make in your essay?
STUDENT: My thesis statement is that technology has had both positive and negative effects on society, but the positives outweigh the negatives.
COACH: That's an excellent thesis statement! Now, let's discuss how you can support it. What evidence do you have that supports your argument?
STUDENT: I have statistics and research on how technology has increased productivity and efficiency, as well as improved communication and access to information. I also have examples of how technology has caused problems such as privacy issues and cyber-bullying.
COACH: Great. Now, let's talk about structure. How are you organizing your essay?
STUDENT: I'm planning to start with an introduction that outlines my thesis statement, then move on to the body of the essay where I will discuss the positive and negative effects of technology in detail. I'll then provide evidence to support my argument and finish with a conclusion that summarizes my main points.
