COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UCLA and Yale and I'm not sure how to get started with my essay.
COACH: That's a great question! How much do you know about the college admission process?
STUDENT: Not much, I'm afraid.
COACH: No problem, let me explain the basics. College admissions committees look at a variety of factors when making their decisions, including your academic performance, extracurricular activities, and other personal qualities. Your essay is an opportunity to tell them more about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the school.
First, you'll want to brainstorm ideas for your essay. Think about your experiences, interests, and values that make you unique. What have you done in the past that has made you proud or challenged you in some way? You can also use your essay to highlight any volunteer work or community service you've done, as well as any awards or accolades you've received.
Once you have some ideas, you'll want to start writing. Make sure your essay is clear, concise, and well-structured. Use vivid language and vivid imagery to draw the reader in. Also, make sure to proofread your essay before submitting it.
Finally, consider asking someone to review your essay. A teacher, mentor, or even a family member can provide valuable feedback and help you make sure it's the best it can be.
