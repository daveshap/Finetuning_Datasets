STUDENT: how does financing college work?
COACH: Financing college can be a complicated subject, but it is important to understand the different options available. The most common way to finance college is through scholarships, grants, and loans. Scholarships and grants are often based on academic achievement or financial need, while loans require repayment with interest. It is important to research all of your options and find the one that best fits your situation.
