COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: That's a great question! To make your essay more engaging, the best thing to do is to focus on telling a story. Think about the experiences you’ve had that have shaped who you are today and how they can be used to show the admissions committee who you are and why you’re a great fit for their school. You want to give them a glimpse of your life and how you think and act, so make sure to include plenty of details and vivid descriptions. Also, try to use a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary to keep your essay interesting.
