COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I am applying to UNC and Yale, and I'm struggling with my admissions essay.
COACH: Okay, can you tell me a bit about what you're writing about?
STUDENT: Well, I'm trying to write about my faith and how it has shaped me. I'm a Christian, so I want to talk about how my beliefs have impacted my life.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic to explore! What specifically do you want to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: I guess I want to highlight how my faith has been a source of strength and resilience in my life, but at the same time, I'm worried that it will come across as too boring or cliche.
COACH: That's a valid concern. Have you thought about how you can make your essay stand out?
STUDENT: Not really, no.
COACH: Okay, let's start by thinking about what makes your faith story unique. What are some personal experiences or perspectives that you can draw from?
STUDENT: Hmm, well I have been involved in my church for many years, and I have seen firsthand how it has helped me grow and develop as a person. I also have a strong sense of social justice and I think that is partly due to my faith.
COACH: Great, those are both great points to explore. What other elements of your faith can you include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I think I want to talk about how my faith has helped me become more compassionate and understanding of others. And I want to talk about how it has opened my eyes to the world around me.
COACH: Perfect! Those are great ideas. Now, how can you make sure your essay is interesting and engaging?
STUDENT: I think I need to focus on the personal aspects of my faith and how it has impacted me on a personal level. I want to make sure that my essay is not just a list of facts and figures, but rather a story that conveys my beliefs and values.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. Make sure to use vivid language and imagery to make your essay come alive. Also, don't forget to include concrete examples to illustrate your points. Good luck!
