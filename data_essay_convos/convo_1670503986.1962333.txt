COACH: Well, when writing a grant application, it's important to make sure that you include all the necessary information. This includes your background and qualifications, your goals and objectives, and any special skills or experiences you have that may be relevant to the grant. You should also explain why you are applying for this particular grant and why you think you deserve it. Finally, provide evidence that you are capable and deserving of the grant, such as awards or letters of recommendation.
