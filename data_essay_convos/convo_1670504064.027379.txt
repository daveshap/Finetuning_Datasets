COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: Thatâ€™s a great question! A good way to know when your essay is finished is to read it through and make sure that it addresses the prompt, has an introduction, body, and conclusion, and that all of your points are well-supported by evidence. Once you feel like you have addressed the prompt and provided enough evidence to support your points, then your essay is likely finished.
