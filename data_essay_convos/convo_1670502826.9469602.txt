COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do I write about in my personal statement?
COACH: That's a great question! You want to focus on something that is meaningful to you and will make you stand out from other applicants. Think about a story or experience that has shaped who you are today and how it relates to your future goals. It should be something that you can talk about in detail and provide evidence for.
STUDENT: What kind of evidence should I include?
COACH: Evidence can come in many forms, such as personal anecdotes, statistics, or quotes from experts. You want to make sure that the evidence you provide is relevant to the point you are trying to make. For example, if you are writing about how you overcame a difficult obstacle, you may want to provide an example of how you did so.
STUDENT: How do I make my essay persuasive?
COACH: To make your essay persuasive, you need to use strong language and make sure your arguments are supported with evidence. You also want to make sure that your essay has a clear thesis statement and that each paragraph is focused on a single point. Finally, make sure to end your essay with a powerful conclusion that ties everything together.
