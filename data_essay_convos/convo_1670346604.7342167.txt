COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm trying to write my college admission essay and I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about.
COACH: That's a great question. Let me ask you this: What topics are you passionate about? 
STUDENT: Well, I'm really interested in volunteer work, and I'm also passionate about issues related to sexism, especially in Europe.
COACH: Those are both excellent topics for an essay. Have you done any volunteer work that you could write about?
STUDENT: Yes, I've done a lot of volunteer work in my community. I helped organize a fundraiser for a local charity and I've tutored elementary school students in reading.
COACH: That sounds like a great start! You could focus your essay on how your volunteer work has shaped your values and beliefs. You could also talk about the importance of giving back to the community and how it has impacted your life.
Alternatively, if you want to focus on sexism in Europe, you could explore the history of the issue and discuss how it has changed over time. You could also talk about the current state of gender inequality in Europe, and how it affects people's lives.
No matter which topic you choose, make sure to focus on what makes your essay engaging and unique. What experiences have you had that you can incorporate into your essay? 
STUDENT: I've done some research on sexism in Europe and I've attended a few conferences about gender equality. I think I could talk about how I've become more aware of the issue and how it has motivated me to take action.
COACH: That's a great idea. You could talk about how your research and experiences have given you a greater understanding of the issue and how it has shaped your views. You could also discuss how you've been inspired to take action and how you plan to continue advocating for gender equality in the future. 
Also, when writing your essay, make sure to use vivid language and personal anecdotes to make your story come alive. This will help make your essay stand out and show the admissions committee who you are as a person. Good luck!
