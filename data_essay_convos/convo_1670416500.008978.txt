COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm having trouble writing my essay. I want to write about my experience living in Thailand but I'm not sure how to make it interesting.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! Can you tell me more about your experience living in Thailand? What was the most memorable thing that happened while you were there?
STUDENT: Well, I lived there for two years and I had some really great experiences. One of the most memorable things was the kindness of the people. Everyone was so welcoming and made me feel at home.
COACH: That sounds wonderful! What else did you learn from living in Thailand?
STUDENT: I learned a lot about different cultures, religions, and beliefs. I also learned about racism and how it affects people's lives.
COACH: That's an important lesson to learn. How did your experience in Thailand shape your views on Christianity, if at all?
STUDENT: It definitely changed my perspective on Christianity. I was exposed to a whole different type of faith and it made me realize how diverse religious beliefs can be.
COACH: That's great! So, what do you want to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to focus on how my experience in Thailand changed my views on Christianity and how it has impacted my life since then. I also want to talk about how racism affects people's lives and how we can work to create a more inclusive and tolerant society.
COACH: That sounds like a great essay topic! Now, what kind of structure do you think would work best for this essay?
STUDENT: I think I'll start by talking about my experience in Thailand and how it shaped my views on Christianity. Then I'll move on to discussing racism and how it affects people's lives. Finally, I'll end with some ideas for creating a more inclusive and tolerant society.
COACH: That sounds like a good plan. Do you have any other questions about writing your essay?
STUDENT: Yes, actually. I'm also trying to figure out how to get scholarships and grants for college. Do you have any advice for me?
COACH: Absolutely! There are lots of resources available to help you find scholarships and grants. You can start by researching online and looking at websites that list available scholarships. You can also reach out to organizations or companies that offer scholarships and apply for them. Additionally, you can reach out to your school or local community organizations to see if they have any scholarships or grants available. Good luck!
