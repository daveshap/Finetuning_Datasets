COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay for law school and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to focus on.
COACH: Okay, let's start by talking about your goals and objectives. What are your long-term plans?
STUDENT: Well, I want to become a lawyer, but I also have a strong interest in charity work and Buddhism. I'm thinking of combining the two by doing pro bono work in developing countries.
COACH: That sounds like an ambitious goal. Do you think you have the skills and resources to make it happen?
STUDENT: I think so. I've been studying Buddhism for years and I'm already involved in some charity work. I'm also planning to study abroad in Germany next year, which would give me a great opportunity to learn more about international law.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a clear direction and plan for achieving your goals. Now, how can you use this information to craft a compelling essay for law school?
STUDENT: Well, I want to show the admissions committee that I'm passionate about both charity work and international law, and that I'm committed to making a difference in the world. I also want to demonstrate my knowledge of Buddhism and its relevance to law.
COACH: That's a great start. You could talk about the ways in which your Buddhist beliefs shape your understanding of justice and fairness, and how you plan to use those principles to guide your legal practice. You could also discuss the practical experience you've gained from your charity work, and how it has prepared you for a career in law. Finally, you could talk about the ways in which studying abroad in Germany has given you a unique perspective on international law. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful, thank you! I think I have a better idea of how to structure my essay now.
