COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for advice on how to get scholarships and grants.
COACH: Sure, that's a great question! Let's start by talking about your qualifications. What kind of charity work have you done in the past?
STUDENT: Well, I've done volunteer work at a local animal shelter, tutored elementary school students, and volunteered at a food pantry. 
COACH: That's fantastic! It sounds like you have a lot of great experience that you can draw from when applying for scholarships and grants. Have you considered writing a personal statement to accompany your applications? This can be an effective way to highlight your unique qualifications and experiences. 
STUDENT: Yes, I had thought about that. But I'm not sure where to start. 
COACH: No worries! I'm here to help. A personal statement should include a brief overview of your background, experiences, and goals. It should also explain why you are applying for the scholarship or grant and what you plan to do with the money. You can also include any special achievements or awards you have earned. 
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. What else should I consider when applying for scholarships and grants? 
COACH: In addition to your personal statement, you should also make sure you meet all of the requirements for the scholarship or grant you are applying for. This includes things like GPA, test scores, and other qualifications. You should also make sure you submit your application before the deadline. Finally, you should follow up with the organization after you submit your application to ensure it was received and reviewed. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful. What about after college? How do I find a job? 
COACH: Finding a job after college is a big step, but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, take advantage of any career services offered by your college or university. These services can provide valuable resources such as resume assistance, job search strategies, and networking opportunities. Additionally, you should use your network of contacts to reach out to potential employers. Finally, make sure you stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends and news so you can stay ahead of the competition.
