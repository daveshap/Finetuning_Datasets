COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for some help with my college essay. I'm from a poor family and I want to go to college in Europe, but I have no idea what to write about.
COACH: That's understandable. It can be difficult to come up with ideas for an essay when you don't have much experience or background knowledge. What kind of topics or themes do you think would be interesting to explore in your essay?
STUDENT: I'm really interested in creativity and art, so maybe I could write about the creative process and how it can be used to overcome obstacles.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! How do you think you could apply this to your own experience?
STUDENT: Well, I could talk about how I've used my creativity to deal with the challenges of coming from a poor family. I could also discuss how I've used my creativity to find new ways to make money and support myself.
COACH: That's a great idea! You could also talk about how creativity has helped you to stay motivated and inspired, even when faced with difficult circumstances. Do you have any other ideas for your essay?
STUDENT: I was also thinking I could talk about how art and creativity can be used to express emotions and thoughts that are hard to put into words.
COACH: That's a great idea! You could talk about how you use art and creativity to express yourself, and how it has helped you to cope with difficult situations. You could also discuss how art and creativity can be used to bring people together and create positive change. Once you have your ideas down, you can start thinking about how to structure your essay and what evidence you could use to support your points.
