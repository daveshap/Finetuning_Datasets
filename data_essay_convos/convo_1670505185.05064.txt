STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: One great way to make your essay more engaging is to use vivid language and imagery. For example, if you are describing a scene or event, think about the details you can include to make it come alive for the reader. Try to use adjectives and adverbs to describe the setting and characters. You can also use metaphors and similes to create an interesting comparison and make your writing more vivid. Additionally, you can use storytelling techniques to help draw the reader in and make them want to keep reading.
