COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first generation college student and I'm applying to Duke University. I'm looking for advice on how to make my essay stand out and get noticed.
COACH: Congratulations on taking the initiative to apply to Duke! It's great to hear that you are a first-generation college student. That means you have the opportunity to bring a unique perspective to your application. Tell me more about your essay. What do you want to focus on?
STUDENT: I want to focus on my experiences as a neurodiverse student. I want to talk about how my neurodiversity has shaped my academic journey and how it has helped me become the person I am today.
COACH: That's an excellent topic for your essay! Neurodiversity is an important issue that is often overlooked in college applications. You can use your essay to show admissions officers how your experiences as a neurodiverse student have made you a stronger applicant and a better person. What other topics do you want to cover in your essay?
STUDENT: I also want to talk about my financial need and how I plan to finance my education. I'm looking for scholarships and grants, but I'm not sure how to go about it.
COACH: That's a great question! There are many resources available to help students find scholarships and grants. I recommend starting by researching scholarships specific to neurodiversity. Additionally, there are many websites that list scholarships and grants based on different criteria, such as merit, financial need, and major. Finally, you can reach out to organizations, such as the National Association for College Admission Counseling, to get more information about scholarships and grants.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'm also interested in applying to grad school after I finish my undergraduate degree. Do you have any advice on how to prepare for grad school applications?
COACH: Absolutely! Start by doing research on the different grad school programs you're interested in. Make sure to read up on their admission requirements and application processes. Additionally, you should start preparing your resume and writing samples early. Finally, make sure to reach out to professors and mentors who can provide you with letters of recommendation. All of these steps will help you put together a strong grad school application.
