COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do I write about in my personal statement?
COACH: That's a great question. First, let me ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of what you want to convey in your essay. What are your academic and professional goals?
STUDENT: My academic goal is to attend law school and become an attorney. Professionally, I want to work in a corporate law firm and use my legal skills to help people in need.
COACH: That's great! Now that I have a better understanding of your goals, let's talk about how to write a successful personal statement for law school. The key to a successful personal statement is to tell a story about yourself that will capture the attention of the admissions committee. You want to highlight your unique experiences, strengths, and interests that make you stand out from the crowd. Think about what makes you unique and how you can communicate that in your essay. 
STUDENT: I understand. What type of structure should I use for my essay?
COACH: A great way to structure your essay is to divide it into three parts. In the first part, you should introduce yourself and explain why you want to attend law school. In the second part, you should discuss your relevant experience and qualifications. In the third part, you should discuss your future plans and how you plan to use your law degree to achieve your professional goals. Make sure to use specific examples and stories to illustrate your points and keep the reader engaged. 
STUDENT: That sounds great. Is there anything else I should consider when writing my essay?
COACH: Yes, there are a few other things to keep in mind. First, make sure to proofread your essay multiple times to ensure there are no spelling or grammar errors. Second, be sure to follow the instructions of the essay prompt closely. Finally, don't be afraid to be creative and take risks with your essay. Show the admissions committee who you are and why you are the perfect fit for their law school.
