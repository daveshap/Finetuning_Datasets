COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: An engaging essay is one that captures the reader's attention and keeps them interested in the story you are telling. To do this, you need to focus on creating a strong narrative structure, using vivid language, and including meaningful details. You also want to make sure your essay is well organized and has a clear purpose. Finally, make sure you are writing about something that is truly meaningful to you and that you can write about passionately.
