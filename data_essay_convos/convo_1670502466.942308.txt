COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admission essay is your chance to show the admissions committee who you are as a person and why you would be a great fit for their school. It's also an opportunity to demonstrate your writing skills and show that you can clearly articulate your thoughts. It's important to make a good impression with your essay, so it's important to put in the effort to make it the best it can be.
