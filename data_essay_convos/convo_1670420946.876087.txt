COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Princeton and I'm a first-generation college student. I'm trying to figure out what makes an essay engaging and what I should write about in my personal statement.
COACH: Great, that's a great question. First, let's start with what makes an essay engaging. A good essay should have a strong narrative arc, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It should also be well-structured, with an introduction that grabs the reader's attention, body paragraphs that provide evidence and support for your argument, and a conclusion that ties everything together. Additionally, it should be written in a clear, concise style that is easy to read and understand.
Now, when it comes to what you should write about in your personal statement, that really depends on what you want to say. Your personal statement should reflect who you are and tell your story. Consider what makes you unique, what experiences and values have shaped you, and how you could contribute to the Princeton community. For example, if you are Jewish, you could discuss how your faith has shaped your values and how you could bring that perspective to the college. You could also talk about your goals and aspirations, and how you plan to use your education to make a difference in the world.
Ultimately, the goal of your essay is to stand out from the crowd and show the admissions committee why you would be an ideal candidate for Princeton. So, use your essay to showcase your individuality and demonstrate why you would be a great addition to their campus.
