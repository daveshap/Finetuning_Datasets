COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question. The best way to know if your essay is good is to read it out loud and see how it flows. Does it make sense? Are there any areas that could use more explanation or clarification? Once you've done that, it's also helpful to get feedback from someone else who can provide an objective view of your essay.
