COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm trying to write an essay for college admission, but I'm not sure how the process works.
COACH: That's a great question. The college admissions process can vary from school to school, but generally it involves submitting an application, which includes personal information and essays, and then waiting for a response. Depending on the school, there may also be interviews or other components as well. Can you tell me more about the essay you're writing?
STUDENT: Sure! I'm applying to Duke University, and I want to write an essay about creativity and art.
COACH: That's a great topic! When writing an essay, it's important to have a clear structure. Generally, essays should have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction is your hook; it should draw the reader in and give them a sense of what the essay will be about. Your body paragraphs should provide evidence and support for your main argument. And the conclusion should be a summary of the essay, tying everything together. Does that help?
STUDENT: Yes, that makes sense. I'm also considering studying abroad in Europe, so I was thinking of incorporating that into my essay.
COACH: That could be a great addition! You could talk about how studying abroad in Europe would give you a unique perspective on art and creativity, or how it would expand your worldview and open you up to new ideas. You could also discuss the cultural and historical influences of art in Europe and how they would inform your own creative work. Does that sound like something you'd like to explore?
