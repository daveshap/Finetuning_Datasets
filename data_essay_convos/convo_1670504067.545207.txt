COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question. It can be difficult to know when your essay is finished, but there are a few things you can do to help. First, make sure you have answered the prompt completely. Have you included all the necessary information? Second, review your essay for any typos or grammar mistakes. Lastly, read it out loud to yourself or someone else and make sure it flows well and sounds like your own voice. If you can answer yes to all of these questions, then your essay should be finished.
