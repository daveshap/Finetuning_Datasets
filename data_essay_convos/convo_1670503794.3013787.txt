COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A conclusion should be a summary of your essay. It should restate your main points and give a sense of closure. Make sure that your conclusion is not too long, as admissions officers may have already read many essays and you donâ€™t want to bore them. Also, try to avoid introducing new information in your conclusion.
