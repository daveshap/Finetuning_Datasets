COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a high school student and I'm applying to college. I want to go to Yale to study engineering, but I have no idea what to write about in my essay.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a clear goal and personal objective. Let's start by talking about your background and the experiences that have shaped who you are today. What have been some of the most influential moments in your life?
STUDENT: Well, I've always been interested in engineering and technology. I started tinkering with robots in middle school and it's been a passion of mine ever since. I was also part of a robotics club in high school, which really helped me hone my skills and develop a better understanding of engineering.
COACH: That's awesome! It sounds like you have a strong interest in engineering and technology, and you've put in a lot of hard work to pursue that passion. How have these experiences shaped your goals and ambitions for the future?
STUDENT: Well, I want to use my knowledge and experience to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that engineering can be used to solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity, and I want to be part of that solution.
COACH: That's a great ambition! Now, let's think about how you can incorporate this into your essay. What specific experiences or stories can you share that demonstrate your commitment to engineering and your desire to make a difference?
STUDENT: Well, I recently worked on a project to build a solar-powered water pump for a rural village in India. It was a challenging experience, but it was also incredibly rewarding. I learned a lot about engineering and how to apply it to real-world problems, and I'm proud of the impact that our project had on the community.
COACH: That's an amazing story! You could definitely use this as a starting point for your essay. Think about how this experience has shaped your goals and ambitions for the future, and how it demonstrates your commitment to using engineering to make a positive impact. Good luck!
