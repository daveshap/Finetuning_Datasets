COACH: That's a great question! It sounds like you are looking for some guidance on how to make your essay stand out from the rest. Can you tell me a bit more about yourself and your experiences? What makes you unique?

COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot to offer potential employers. In order to make your essay stand out, you'll need to focus on highlighting your unique experiences and skills. How can you use your travels to demonstrate your commitment to learning and exploring new things?
STUDENT: I think I can talk about how my travels have given me a better understanding of different cultures and perspectives. I can also discuss how I've developed problem-solving skills and resilience from having to adapt to unfamiliar environments.
COACH: That's a great start! You can also discuss how your travels have helped you develop a greater understanding of different people and cultures, which could be beneficial to any employer. Additionally, you could talk about how your travels have taught you to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.
