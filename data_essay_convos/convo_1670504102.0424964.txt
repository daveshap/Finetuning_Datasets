COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: A good way to know when your essay is finished is to make sure that you have a clear thesis statement. This should be the main point of your essay and should be stated at the end of your introduction. Once you have this, you can then work on developing your points and making sure they are all connected to your thesis.
