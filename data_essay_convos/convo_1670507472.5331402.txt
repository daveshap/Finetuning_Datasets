COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: That's a great question. Before we dive into the specifics of writing an opening, let's talk about the overall essay you're writing. What type of essay is it? 
STUDENT: It's a grant application. 
COACH: Great! A grant application is a persuasive essay, so your opening should be compelling and draw the reader in. The best way to do that is by introducing the topic and providing a brief overview of the main points you'll cover. This should be done in a way that is interesting, engaging, and relevant to the purpose of the essay. 
To make sure your introduction is effective, ask yourself these questions: 
1. Does my introduction provide a clear and concise summary of my essay? 
2. Does my introduction grab the reader's attention? 
3. Does my introduction establish the context and purpose of the essay?
Answering these questions will help you create an introduction that sets the tone for the rest of your essay. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful, thank you!
