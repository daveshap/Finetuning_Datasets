COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: That's a great question. The most important thing to keep in mind when writing an essay is to make sure that it's interesting and engaging for the reader. You want to make sure that your essay has a clear structure, with a beginning, middle, and end. You should also make sure to use vivid language, and to focus on the main points you want to make. Additionally, make sure to include anecdotes or stories that can help to illustrate your points.
