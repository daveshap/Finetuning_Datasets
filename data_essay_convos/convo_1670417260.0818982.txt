COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write a personal statement for college admissions and I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about.
COACH: Sure, let's start by talking about what topics you're interested in. What kind of things have you been involved in that you could write about?
STUDENT: Well, I've done some charity work and I'm very passionate about Christianity and neurodiversity.
COACH: That sounds like a great place to start. Let's talk a bit more about each of those topics. What kind of charity work have you done? 
STUDENT: I've volunteered at a local food bank and I've also done some fundraising for a local shelter.
COACH: That's wonderful! It sounds like you have a lot of experience with charity work that you could draw on for your essay. Can you tell me a bit more about how your faith influences your life?
STUDENT: Absolutely. Christianity is a big part of my life and it has shaped the way I think about things and how I interact with others. I try to live my life according to the teachings of Jesus and use those teachings to guide my decisions.
COACH: That's really inspiring. And how about neurodiversity?
STUDENT: Neurodiversity is something that I'm very passionate about. I think it's important to recognize the importance of neurodiversity and the unique perspectives it brings to the table. I believe everyone should be given the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their neurological differences.
COACH: That's a great point. Now, let's talk a bit more about how college admissions works. What do you need to do to apply to college? 
STUDENT: Generally, you need to fill out an application, submit your transcripts, and write a personal statement. Some colleges also require letters of recommendation and standardized test scores.
COACH: Alright, so you know what you need to do to apply. Now, let's focus on your personal statement. What do you think are the most important elements to include in your essay?
STUDENT: I think it's important to talk about my experiences, values, and goals. It's also important to be honest and authentic in my writing, so that the admissions committee can get a sense of who I am and why I want to attend their school.
