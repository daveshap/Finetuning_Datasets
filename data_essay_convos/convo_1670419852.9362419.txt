COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm an undergrad student and I'm trying to write an essay about why college matters. I'm having trouble getting started.
COACH: That's a great question! It's important for us to understand why college matters in order to make sure we get the most out of our education. To begin, let's start by talking about what you think is important about college. What do you think makes it so valuable?
STUDENT: Well, I think college is important because it provides access to knowledge and resources that I wouldn't be able to access otherwise. It also gives me the opportunity to meet new people and to network with professionals in my field.
COACH: That's a great point! College can certainly open up new opportunities and provide access to resources that may not be available otherwise. Additionally, college can help you develop skills that will be useful in the future, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. So, why do you think these skills are important?
STUDENT: I think they're important because they help me to become a more well-rounded and successful person. They help me to think through problems and come up with creative solutions. Also, having strong communication skills can help me to network and form relationships with people who can help me to reach my goals.
COACH: Absolutely. Those are all great points. Now, how do you think you can use college to help you achieve your goals?
STUDENT: I think one way is to take advantage of the resources available at my school. For example, I can attend lectures, join clubs and organizations, and participate in internships to gain experience in my field. I can also apply for scholarships and grants to help pay for college expenses.
COACH: That's a great plan! Taking advantage of the resources available to you can definitely help you succeed in college. Additionally, applying for scholarships and grants can help you reduce the cost of college and make it more affordable. Are there any other questions or concerns you have about college?
