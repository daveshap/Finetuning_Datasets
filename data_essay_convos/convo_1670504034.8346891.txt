COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question. A good essay should have a clear and specific thesis statement that outlines your main argument. It should also be well-structured, with an introduction, body, and conclusion, and it should be written in a formal, academic style. Finally, it should be free of errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
