COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do I write about in my personal statement?
COACH: That's a great question! Before you start writing, it's important to think about what you want to communicate in your essay. What are some of your strengths, accomplishments, and passions that you want to highlight? That can help you decide what to write about.
STUDENT: How do I make my essay stand out?
COACH: One way to make your essay stand out is to use vivid language and imagery to paint a picture of your experiences. Also, don't be afraid to be honest and vulnerable in your writing. Admissions officers are looking for genuine reflections of who you are. 
STUDENT: What should I avoid when writing my essay?
COACH: You should avoid cliches and overly-generalized statements. It's also important to avoid using slang or informal language. Finally, it's important to proofread your essay and make sure that it is free from any grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors.
