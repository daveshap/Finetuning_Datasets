COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should wrap up your essay and leave the reader with a clear understanding of your main point. It should also include a call to action, if applicable. Start by summarizing your main points and then restate your thesis. You can also add a few sentences that show the impact of your essay and how it has changed your perspective. Finally, leave the reader with a thought-provoking idea or question.
