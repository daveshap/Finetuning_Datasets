COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi there, I'm looking to apply to the University of North Carolina for law school and I'm trying to figure out how to best showcase my skills and achievements in my essay.
COACH: Great! Can you tell me a bit more about your background?
STUDENT: Sure. I come from a small town in France and I've been studying law since I was a teenager. I'm currently in my final year of college and I'm looking to apply to UNC for law school.
COACH: That sounds like an impressive background. Do you have any experience in the legal field?
STUDENT: Yes, I've done an internship at a local law firm and I've also done some pro bono work for a few charities.
COACH: That's great. So what kind of skills and achievements do you want to highlight in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I think it's important to show that I'm a hardworking and determined individual. I want to demonstrate that I have the skills necessary to be successful in law school, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. I also want to emphasize my leadership skills and my commitment to helping others.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. How do you think you can best showcase these skills and achievements in your essay?
STUDENT: I think I can use examples to illustrate how I've used my skills and experiences to achieve success. For instance, I could talk about how my internship helped me develop my legal knowledge and how my pro bono work has helped me hone my leadership skills.
COACH: That's a great idea. Are there any other areas you're looking for help with?
STUDENT: Actually, yes. I'm also trying to figure out how to get scholarships and grants for law school. Do you have any advice on that?
COACH: Absolutely. There are a number of resources available to help you find scholarships and grants. You can start by researching online and looking for scholarship programs that are specific to law school. You can also reach out to your school's financial aid office to see what options they have available. Additionally, you can look into private organizations that offer scholarships and grants for law school students.
