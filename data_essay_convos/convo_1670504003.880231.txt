COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: It's a subjective question, but there are some criteria you can use to judge the quality of your essay. First, read through it and make sure it's clear and concise. Make sure it's well-structured and that the essay flows logically from one point to the next. Then, make sure your essay is specific and personal. It should be focused on you and your experiences, and it should demonstrate why you're a good fit for the program you're applying to. Finally, make sure your essay is free of spelling and grammar mistakes.
