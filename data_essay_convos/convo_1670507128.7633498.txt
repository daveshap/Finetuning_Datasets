COACH: Perfect! Now let's talk about the body of the essay. What kind of evidence and examples do you need to support your argument? 
STUDENT: I need to include research from scientific studies, statistics, and personal stories from people who have experienced the effects of social media on their mental health. 
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. Finally, let's talk about your conclusion. What do you want to include in it? 
STUDENT: I want to summarize my argument, discuss the implications of my findings, and suggest possible solutions or further research. 
COACH: That sounds great. Now that we have a plan, let's talk about how to actually write your essay. What kind of tips do you need to get started?
