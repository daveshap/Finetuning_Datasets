COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I pick a topic?
COACH: That's a great question! When it comes to writing an admissions essay, you want to make sure that you pick a topic that is interesting and meaningful to you. Think about what you are passionate about, or something that you have experienced that has had a lasting impact on you. You can also look for topics that are relevant to the school you are applying to, and make sure that your essay reflects your own unique perspective.
