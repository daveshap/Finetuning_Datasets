COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a senior in high school and I'm trying to figure out how to apply to college.
COACH: That's great! It's important to start the process early. What sort of questions do you have about the college application process?
STUDENT: Well, I'm not sure what admissions officers are looking for in an application essay. I also don't know how to finance college.
COACH: Sure, those are both important questions. Let's start with the admissions essay. Admissions officers are looking for essays that demonstrate your skills and achievements. They want to see evidence that you have the potential to succeed in college and that you have the dedication to make it through. Additionally, they may be looking for essays that address a certain topic or show that you have a unique perspective on an issue. For example, if you're applying to a college that focuses on gender studies, they may be looking for an essay that discusses sexism or gender roles.
As for financing college, there are several options. You can apply for grants, scholarships, and loans. Grants and scholarships are usually need-based and don't need to be paid back. Loans, on the other hand, need to be repaid with interest. You can also look into work-study programs or employer tuition assistance. It's important to research all of your options and talk to your family and school counselors to find out what's best for you.
