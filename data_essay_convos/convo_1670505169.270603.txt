STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: A great way to make your essay more engaging is to focus on the story behind your experiences. Instead of simply stating facts, explain how you got to where you are and why you made the decisions you did. This will help make your essay more personal and relatable to the reader. Additionally, make sure to use vivid language and imagery to help draw the reader in.
