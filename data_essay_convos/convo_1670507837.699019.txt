COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question. The best way to know when your essay is finished is to ask yourself if it meets the requirements of the assignment and if it communicates your ideas clearly. If you can answer yes to both of those questions, then your essay is finished. However, it's also important to make sure that your essay is free from errors and that it follows any formatting guidelines set out by your professor. Do you have any other questions about the completion of your essay?
