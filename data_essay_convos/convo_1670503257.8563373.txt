COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how does financing college work?
COACH: Financing college can be done in a few different ways. You can apply for scholarships, grants, and loans. Scholarships are awarded based on academic or other criteria, grants are typically need-based, and loans are borrowed money that must be paid back with interest. It's important to research each option thoroughly and understand the terms and conditions associated with them.
