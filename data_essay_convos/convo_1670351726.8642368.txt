COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for help with my grad school application essay. I want to talk about my experiences in France and how they have shaped my outlook on life.
COACH: Interesting! Could you tell me a bit more about your experiences in France?
STUDENT: Sure. I spent six months abroad in France last year. It was an incredible experience that really opened my eyes to the world. I got to experience different cultures, explore new places, and meet amazing people.
COACH: That sounds like an amazing experience! What did you learn from it?
STUDENT: Well, I learned a lot about myself and the world around me. I developed a better understanding of different cultures and perspectives, and I also learned how to be more open-minded and tolerant of different points of view. I also learned a lot about Buddhism and its principles, which has helped me to become more mindful and reflective in my life.
COACH: That's wonderful! What else do you think you can talk about in your essay?
STUDENT: I also want to talk about how I overcame some of the challenges I faced while in France. I faced a lot of rejection and obstacles, but I was able to push through and come out stronger on the other side. I want to emphasize the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.
COACH: That's an important lesson to learn. How else do you think you can demonstrate your growth and development in your essay?
STUDENT: I also want to talk about the volunteer work I did while in France. I volunteered with various organizations to help those in need and spread awareness about different social issues. I believe this experience taught me a lot about the power of selflessness and compassion.
