COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm looking for advice on how to apply to college.
COACH: Great! What kind of information are you looking for? Do you have any particular questions or topics that you would like to focus on?
STUDENT: Well, I'm interested in writing about social issues and Buddhism. I'm also wondering what admissions officers look for in a personal statement.
COACH: That's a great topic! When it comes to writing about social issues and Buddhism, it's important to think about how these two topics intersect and how they can be used to make a statement. For example, you could talk about how Buddhist teachings can be applied to social justice issues or how Buddhist philosophy can help us to understand the complexities of the world today. 
In terms of what admissions officers look for in a personal statement, they will be looking for an essay that is clear, well-structured, and shows your unique perspective. It should also demonstrate your knowledge of the subject matter and reflect your passion for the topic. It's also important to avoid clich√©s and to show your creativity. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful, thank you! How can I make sure my essay stands out?
COACH: A great way to make your essay stand out is to use vivid language and to tell a story. Think about how you can bring your topic to life and make it come alive for the reader. Also, be sure to use strong examples to illustrate your points and to back up your arguments. Finally, make sure to proofread your essay and get feedback from someone you trust before submitting it.
