COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do grants work?
COACH: Grants are a type of financial aid that does not need to be repaid. They are typically awarded by the government, foundations, or other organizations to help students pay for college. To apply for grants, you'll need to fill out an application and provide information about your financial situation, academic record, and any extracurricular activities. The organization awarding the grant will then review your application and decide if you qualify for the grant.
