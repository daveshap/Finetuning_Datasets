UNC is my top choice and I'm trying to get into the program.

COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a solid foundation for the essay. Now, let's focus on making it unique. What makes you stand out from other applicants? What experiences have you had that have shaped you and your goals?
STUDENT: Well, I've been working in a research lab since high school and I've been able to see firsthand the impact that science can have on people's lives. I've also been involved in various volunteer activities, which have helped me gain a better understanding of the healthcare system and the challenges that people face. All of these experiences have motivated me to pursue a career in medicine and to make a difference in the lives of others.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of experience and passion that you can draw from. How can you use this to make your essay stand out from the rest?

COACH: That's a great approach! Now, let's talk about the structure of the essay. What kind of format do you think would be best for your essay?
STUDENT: I think I'd like to use a narrative format, where I tell a story about my experiences and how they have shaped my goals. I think this will be more engaging and memorable than just listing facts and figures.
COACH: That's a great idea! Now, let's talk about the tone of the essay. What kind of tone do you want to set?
STUDENT: I want to be professional but also passionate. I want to show admissions officers that I'm serious about my goals and that I'm dedicated to making a difference.
