COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I pick a topic?
COACH: That's a great question. Before we dive into what topic to pick, can you tell me more about the type of essay you need to write? Is it for a class, a dissertation, or something else?
STUDENT: It's for a dissertation.
COACH: Great! Dissertations are a big project, so it's important to pick a topic that you're passionate about and that you can research thoroughly. Have you already thought of any topics you might be interested in exploring?
