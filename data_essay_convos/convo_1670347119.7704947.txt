COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for some advice on how to write a college application essay.
COACH: Great! What kind of college are you applying to?
STUDENT: I'm interested in attending medical school in Germany.
COACH: Alright, so you need help with a medical school essay. What do you want to focus on in your essay? 
STUDENT: I want to show my interest in the field of medicine and my knowledge of the German healthcare system.
COACH: That's a great topic! How can you demonstrate your knowledge of the German healthcare system?
STUDENT: I have been doing research on the topic and I think I understand the basics. I also have some experience working in a hospital in China.
COACH: That's great! You can definitely use that experience to your advantage. Have you thought about how you will structure your essay? 
STUDENT: Not yet, I'm still trying to figure out what to include.
COACH: That's understandable. A good place to start is to think about what makes you a unique applicant. What experiences have you had and what skills have you developed that make you stand out from other applicants?
STUDENT: Well, I've done a lot of volunteer work in hospitals and I'm also fluent in both German and Chinese.
COACH: Those are great qualities to highlight in your essay! Now, have you started researching other aspects of the application process such as how to apply to college and how to get scholarships and grants? 
STUDENT: Yes, I've been doing some research but I'm still not sure how to go about it.
COACH: That's understandable. I'm happy to help you with that. Let's start by talking about how to apply to college. What do you need to do to submit a successful application?
