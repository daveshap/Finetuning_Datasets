COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should be a summary of the main points of your essay. It should also include a statement that ties all the points together and reinforces your thesis. Make sure to restate your thesis in the conclusion and explain why it's important.
