COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm trying to write my college admission essay but I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about.
GRAD COACH: Alright, let's start by understanding your goals. What do you want to study in college and why? 
STUDENT: I want to study international relations and foreign policy. I'm interested in learning more about different countries and cultures, particularly China, which is where my family is from. 
GRAD COACH: That sounds great! It sounds like you have a strong connection to China and an interest in international relations. So now let's focus on how you can use that connection to write an effective essay. What skills and achievements have you developed that are related to your interest in China and international relations? 
STUDENT: Well, I've taken a few classes in Chinese language and culture, and I've done some volunteer work with a local organization that works to promote cultural exchange between China and the US. I've also been part of a student organization focused on international relations and global affairs. 
GRAD COACH: Excellent! Those experiences could be a great starting point for your essay. How have these experiences shaped your understanding of China and international relations? Have you gained any valuable insights or skills that you think would be beneficial in college or grad school? 
STUDENT: Definitely! Through my language classes, I've gained a better understanding of Chinese culture and history, which I think will be really helpful when studying international relations. My volunteer work has also taught me a lot about how to communicate and collaborate with people from different backgrounds, which I think will be really useful in a college or grad school setting. 
GRAD COACH: That's great! So now let's look at how you can use these experiences to write a compelling college essay. What themes or topics have you identified that you'd like to write about? 
STUDENT: I'd like to write about how my experiences with Chinese language and culture have helped shape my understanding of international relations. I'd also like to talk about how my volunteer work has given me the skills to effectively communicate and collaborate with people from different backgrounds. 
GRAD COACH: Perfect! Those sound like great topics for your essay. Now let's talk about how you can structure your essay and make it stand out. What kind of evidence can you provide to support your points? How can you show the admissions committee that you're the right fit for their program? 
STUDENT: I can provide examples of how my language classes have helped me gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and how my volunteer work has given me the skills to effectively communicate with people from different backgrounds. I can also talk about how I plan to use the knowledge and skills I've gained to pursue a career in international relations. 
GRAD COACH: Wonderful! That's a great start. Now let's talk about the specific details of your essay. What kind of structure do you think will work best for your essay? What kind of language and tone should you use? 
STUDENT: I think it would be best to start with a brief introduction to my background and my interest in international relations and China, then move into the body of the essay where I discuss my experiences with Chinese language and culture and how they've helped shape my understanding of international relations. I'll also talk about how my volunteer work has given me the skills to communicate and collaborate with people from different backgrounds. For the conclusion, I'll summarize the main points of my essay and talk about how I plan to use the knowledge and skills I've gained to pursue a career in international relations. As for language and tone, I think it would be best to keep it professional yet conversational. 
GRAD COACH: That sounds like a great plan! I think you have a solid structure for your essay and a good sense of the language and tone you should use. Now let's talk about how you can apply to college. What kind of process have you gone through so far? 
STUDENT: I've done some research on different colleges and universities and I've narrowed down my list to a few that I'm interested in. I've also started looking into the application requirements and deadlines. 
GRAD COACH: Great! Now let's talk about how you can make sure you're submitting the best application possible. What kind of resources do you need to make sure your application stands out? 
STUDENT: I think I need to make sure I'm submitting a well-written essay that really showcases my skills and achievements. I also need to make sure I'm following all the application guidelines and deadlines. 
GRAD COACH: Absolutely. Those are both important steps in the application process. Is there anything else you need help with?
