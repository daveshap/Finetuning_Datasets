COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: I'm applying to Duke University and I'm writing an essay about Buddhism and how it relates to social issues.
COACH: That's a great topic! Could you tell me more about what you want to focus on in your essay? 
STUDENT: Well, I want to talk about the teachings of Buddhism and how they can be applied to modern social issues. I want to look at how Buddhism can provide solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems.
COACH: That sounds like a very interesting topic. Do you have any specific examples or case studies in mind that you want to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Yes, I was thinking about looking at how Buddhist principles have been used to address poverty in India. I also wanted to compare and contrast the approaches taken by Princeton and MIT in their research on Buddhism.
COACH: That's a great idea. Let's focus on the Indian poverty example first. What are some of the key points you want to make in your essay about Buddhism and poverty in India?
STUDENT: I want to talk about how Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and selflessness, which can be applied to helping people in poverty.
