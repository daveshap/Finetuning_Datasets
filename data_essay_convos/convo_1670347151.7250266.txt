STUDENT: I think I have a unique perspective on my field because I come from a diverse background. I also think I'm creative and have good problem-solving skills.
COACH: Great! Those are excellent qualities to highlight. Now, let's talk about how to make your essay engaging. Have you thought about using stories or anecdotes to illustrate your points? This can be a great way to make your essay more interesting and memorable.
STUDENT: That's a great idea. I think I can find some stories that will help illustrate my points.
COACH: Wonderful! That's a great start. Now, let's talk about the language you use in your essay. Make sure to use clear, concise language that conveys your ideas effectively. Avoid using overly complex words or phrases that might confuse the reader.
STUDENT: Got it. I'll make sure to keep it simple and straightforward.
