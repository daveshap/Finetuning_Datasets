COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i get started writing?
COACH: The most important thing to do when writing a persuasive essay is to pick a topic that you feel passionate about and can argue for. Once you have chosen a topic, you should brainstorm ideas and arguments that you can make to support your point of view. After that, you should create an outline of your essay so that you can organize your thoughts and arguments in a logical order. Finally, you can start writing the essay, making sure to include evidence to back up your claims.
