COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should be the icing on the cake of your essay. You want to leave the reader with a lasting impression and a sense of closure. Start by summarizing the main points of your essay in a few sentences. Then, offer a thought-provoking insight or reflection that ties your ideas together. This is your chance to show the admissions committee why you are a great fit for their school.
