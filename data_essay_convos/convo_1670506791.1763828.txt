COACH: That's a great question! Financing college can be a tricky process, but there are a few different options. You may be able to apply for scholarships, grants, or student loans. Scholarships and grants are usually based on academic merit or financial need, and student loans are usually based on your credit history. Do you have any other questions about financing college?
