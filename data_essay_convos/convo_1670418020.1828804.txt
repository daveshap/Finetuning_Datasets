COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm having some trouble getting started on my essay. It's about charity work in Thailand and the Philippines.
COACH: Okay, that's a great topic. Could you tell me a bit more about it? What kind of charity work are you looking at, and why did you decide to focus on Thailand and the Philippines?
STUDENT: Well, I'm looking at how Christianity impacts charity work in both countries. I chose them because I've done some volunteer work in Thailand and I have family in the Philippines.
COACH: That's great. So, you want to look at how Christianity influences charity work in both countries. Are you looking at any particular organizations or events?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm looking at a few different organizations and events. I'm focusing on how they use Christian values to guide their work, and how that impacts their approach to charity work.
COACH: That sounds interesting. What kind of research have you done so far? Have you looked at any specific examples?
STUDENT: Yes, I've done some research on a few different organizations. One is a Christian charity organization in Thailand that focuses on helping the poor, and another is a church-sponsored event in the Philippines that raises money for local charities.
COACH: That's great. It sounds like you have a good foundation for your essay. What kind of structure are you thinking of using? Are you going to compare and contrast the two countries, or focus on one more than the other?
STUDENT: I was thinking of comparing and contrasting the two countries, looking at how Christianity influences charity work in each country and how the approaches differ.
COACH: That sounds like a great approach. What kind of evidence are you going to use to support your points? Are you going to focus on statistics or anecdotal evidence?
STUDENT: I'm going to use both. I'll be looking at statistics from various sources and also talking to people who have been involved in charity work in both countries.
