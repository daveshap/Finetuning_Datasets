COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an admissions essay for a college and I'm having trouble deciding what to focus on.
COACH: Alright, can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What are some of your interests, hobbies, and passions?
STUDENT: Well, I'm really passionate about Judaism and I'm also interested in volunteer work. I'm hoping to go to med school after college, so I'm trying to figure out how to make my admissions essay stand out.
COACH: That sounds like a great focus for your essay! It's important to highlight your unique interests and experiences, so I think it would be helpful to focus on your passion for Judaism and your volunteer work. You could talk about how those experiences have shaped your medical aspirations and how they have influenced your decision to pursue a career in medicine. You could also discuss how your experiences have helped you develop strong skills that would be beneficial in a medical setting. 
STUDENT: That's a great idea, thank you! I also want to make sure I'm prepared for life after college. Do you have any advice for finding a job or getting involved in research?
COACH: Absolutely! One way to get a head start on your career is to get involved in research. You can look for opportunities at your college or at other universities. You could also reach out to professors and mentors in the field who could provide guidance and advice. Additionally, networking is key to finding a job after college. You can attend career fairs, join professional organizations, and reach out to alumni in the field to build connections. And don't forget to use social media to connect with potential employers.
