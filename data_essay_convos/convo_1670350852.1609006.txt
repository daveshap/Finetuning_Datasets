COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a student at NCSU and I'm writing an essay about science. I want to make it engaging and interesting, but I'm not sure how.
COACH: That's great! One way to make an essay engaging is to focus on a specific topic within the broader field of science. For example, if you are writing about science, you could focus on a particular branch such as biology, chemistry, or physics. You could also focus on a specific topic within those branches, like the study of cells or the structure of DNA. By narrowing down your focus, you can create a more interesting and engaging essay.
STUDENT: I see. That makes sense. What other tips do you have for making an essay engaging?
COACH: Another thing you can do is to include personal stories and anecdotes in your essay. If you have any experiences related to science, you can use them to illustrate your points and make the essay more interesting. Additionally, you can use interesting visuals, such as graphs and diagrams, to help explain complex concepts. Finally, you can use humor to make your essay more engaging.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'll definitely keep those things in mind when writing my essay. Is there anything else I should consider?
COACH: Yes, you should also think about the purpose of your essay. Are you writing to inform, to persuade, or to entertain? Knowing the purpose of your essay will help you decide which elements to include in order to make it more engaging. Additionally, you should consider your audience. Who will be reading your essay? Knowing the audience can also help you determine how to make your essay more interesting and engaging. 
STUDENT: That's great advice. I'll definitely keep that in mind. I have one more question. How can I find a job after college, especially if I'm interested in Judaism?
COACH: Finding a job after college can be challenging, but there are many resources available to help. You can start by researching companies and organizations that are related to Judaism. You can also network with people in your industry and attend career fairs. Additionally, you can search online job boards and contact recruiters to inquire about potential job opportunities. Finally, you can reach out to alumni from your college and ask them for advice.
