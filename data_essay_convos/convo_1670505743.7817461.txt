COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what if i get rejected?
COACH: That's a great question. The truth is, there's no guarantee that you'll get accepted. No matter how well you write your essay, the admissions committee may decide to reject your application. However, it's important to remember that your essay is an important part of the admissions process, and it can make all the difference. So it's important to put your best foot forward and make sure that you're presenting yourself in the best light possible.
STUDENT: What should I focus on when writing my essay?
COACH: When writing your essay, it's important to focus on the experiences, qualities, and interests that make you unique. Think about what sets you apart from other applicants and highlight those qualities. It's also important to show the admissions committee why you would be a great fit for their school. Show them that you have done your research, and explain why their school is the perfect place for you. Finally, make sure you are telling a story that is honest and authentic. Your essay should reflect your personality and be written from the heart.
