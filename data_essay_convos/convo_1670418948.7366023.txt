COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UCLA, UNC, and Yale and I'm having trouble coming up with an essay that stands out.
COACH: That's a great question! Before we dive into the specifics of what makes an essay engaging, can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What are your interests and passions?
STUDENT: Sure. I'm really passionate about music, and I'm also interested in exploring social issues like poverty and discrimination.
COACH: Wonderful! It sounds like you have a lot of great ideas that could make your essay stand out. Now, let's talk a bit more specifically about what makes an essay engaging. One important factor is the ability to tell a story. Stories can be powerful tools for conveying your message and making your essay come to life. Another factor is being able to use strong language that conveys emotion. Finally, it's important to write about something that is meaningful to you and that you can connect to on a personal level.
STUDENT: That's really helpful, thank you. I think I have some ideas for my essay now. But I'm also worried about the possibility of rejection. How can I overcome this fear and stay motivated?
COACH: Rejection is a very real fear when it comes to applying to college, but it's important to remember that it's not the end of the world. Even if you don't get accepted to the schools you're applying to, there will still be plenty of other opportunities for you. The important thing is to stay focused on your goals and to keep working hard. Also, it can be helpful to talk to people who have gone through the same experience and to get their advice. Finally, try to find ways to stay positive and motivated throughout the process.
