COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm applying to medical school. I'm having trouble figuring out how to structure my essay.
COACH: It's great that you're taking the initiative to apply to medical school! I'm sure you have a lot of great experiences to share in your essay. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for help with?
STUDENT: Sure, I'm not sure where to start. I know there are certain parts of an essay, like a hook, conclusion, and middle, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.
COACH: That's a great question. Let's start by talking about the different parts of an essay. A hook is the first sentence or two of your essay, and it should capture the reader's attention. The middle of the essay is where you'll go into more detail about your experiences and why you think you're a good fit for medical school. The conclusion should wrap up your essay and provide a summary of your points.
Once you have these pieces in place, you can begin to structure your essay. It's important to think about how you want to organize your ideas and write in a way that flows naturally. You may want to consider using transitions between paragraphs to make sure the essay is cohesive.
STUDENT: That's really helpful! I'm starting to get a better idea of how to structure my essay. What other tips do you have for writing a successful essay?
COACH: One important tip is to make sure you stay focused on the prompt. Read the prompt carefully and make sure your essay addresses all parts of the question. Additionally, it's important to proofread your essay before submitting it. Make sure to check for any grammar or spelling mistakes, as well as any typos. Lastly, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to write and revise your essay. It's important to take the time to make sure your essay is the best it can be.
