COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Princeton and I'm having trouble coming up with an essay topic.
COACH: Great, I'm glad you reached out! Can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What are some of the things that make you unique?
STUDENT: Well, I'm a first-generation college student from a single-parent home. I'm also a part of the neurodiversity community and I'm Muslim. I'm not sure how to incorporate all of these elements into my essay.
COACH: That's a great start! It sounds like you have a lot of experiences that could be used as material for your essay. Let's start with your identity as a first-generation college student from a single-parent home. What are some of the challenges that you've faced growing up in this environment? How has it shaped your outlook on life and shaped your ambitions?
STUDENT: Growing up in a single-parent home was definitely a challenge. My mom worked hard to make sure I had everything I needed, but money was always tight. I had to learn to be resourceful and creative in finding solutions to problems. It also made me realize the importance of education and how it can help people break out of poverty. It motivated me to work hard and pursue my dreams.
COACH: That's a great insight! It's clear that your upbringing has had a big impact on your ambition and your view of the world. What about your identity as a member of the neurodiversity community? How has that affected your life?
STUDENT: Being part of the neurodiversity community has been a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's allowed me to view the world in a unique way and appreciate different perspectives. On the other hand, it's made it difficult for me to fit in at times, and I've had to work hard to be accepted and respected by my peers.
COACH: Absolutely. It sounds like you've had to overcome a lot of challenges in order to be successful. Now, let's talk about your Muslim faith. How has that impacted your life and your view of the world?
STUDENT: Being Muslim has been a huge part of my life since I was a child. It's taught me to be kind and compassionate, to respect others, and to be humble. It's also taught me the importance of education and the power of knowledge. It's helped me to stay focused on my goals and to strive for excellence in all that I do.
COACH: Wonderful! It sounds like your faith has been a source of strength and resilience for you. Now, let's try to tie all of these elements together. What would you say is the main theme of your essay?
STUDENT: I think the main theme of my essay will be overcoming adversity and using my unique background and experiences to achieve success. I want to show the admissions committee how my diverse background has shaped my ambition and my outlook on life.
