COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: That's a great question. There are a few things you can do to make your essay shorter. First, you want to make sure that you are only including the most relevant information. Cut out any unnecessary details or stories that don't support your main point. Also, try to keep your sentences concise and to the point. Don't use overly long words or phrases. Finally, if you need to cut down even more, you can try to reduce the number of paragraphs in your essay.
