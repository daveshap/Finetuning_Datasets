COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question! A good essay should be focused, organized, and clear. It should also be interesting and engaging, so that the reader is compelled to keep reading. Additionally, it should have a strong introduction that grabs the reader's attention, and a conclusion that ties everything together. Finally, make sure to proofread your essay for any errors or typos.
