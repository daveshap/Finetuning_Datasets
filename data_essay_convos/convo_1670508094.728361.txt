COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: That's a great question! The best way to make an essay engaging is to focus on telling a story. Think about the main points you want to make in your essay and how you can use anecdotes or personal experiences to illustrate those points. Also, be sure to use descriptive language to bring your essay to life. Finally, make sure your essay has a clear beginning, middle, and end so that it flows well and keeps the reader engaged.
