COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how long should my essay be?
COACH: That depends on the essay prompt and the requirements of the college or university you are applying to. Can you tell me what the prompt is?
STUDENT: Sure, the prompt is “Describe a challenge or obstacle you have faced and how it has impacted your life.” 
COACH: Great. For this prompt, you should aim for an essay of about 500-600 words. That should give you enough space to provide a detailed description of the challenge and its impact on your life. 
Next, let’s talk about structure. It’s important to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Your introduction should provide some background information and set the tone for your essay. The body should provide details about the challenge and its impact on your life. Finally, your conclusion should wrap up the essay and explain how this experience has shaped you.
Now let’s discuss content. It’s important to focus on the impact that this challenge had on you. Think about how it changed your outlook, influenced your decisions, and shaped your goals. You can also include any lessons you learned or how this experience has made you a better person.
Finally, let’s discuss the importance of proofreading and editing. Make sure you read through your essay multiple times and ask someone else to read it as well. This will help you catch any typos, errors, or awkward phrasing. Additionally, don’t forget to check for grammar and spelling mistakes.
I hope this helps! Good luck with your essay!
