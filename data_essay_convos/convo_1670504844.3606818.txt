STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: The best way to make an essay shorter is to focus on the main point or argument that you are trying to make. Try to eliminate any unnecessary details or examples that donâ€™t directly support your argument. You can also try to use more concise language and sentence structure to make your essay as concise as possible.
