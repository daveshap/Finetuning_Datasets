COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I apply to college?
COACH: That's a great question! A personal statement is an essay that you write when applying to college. It's your chance to show admissions officers who you are and why you would be a great addition to their school. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for help with? 
STUDENT: Yes, I'm having trouble coming up with ideas for my personal statement.
COACH: That's understandable. It can be difficult to know where to start. Let's start by talking about some of your interests and passions. What do you like to do in your free time? 
STUDENT: I love playing sports, reading books, and spending time with my friends.
COACH: Great! That's a great place to start. What about sports do you love? What type of books do you read? And how do you like to spend time with your friends? 
STUDENT: I love playing basketball and football, I enjoy reading mystery and fantasy books, and I like to go out and explore new places with my friends. 
COACH: Wonderful. Now, let's think of ways to use these interests to create a narrative for your essay. What have you learned from playing sports? What themes do you see in the books you read? What have you observed while exploring new places with your friends? 
STUDENT: Playing sports has taught me the importance of teamwork and dedication. The books I read have helped me understand different perspectives and think outside the box. Exploring new places has shown me the beauty of the world and the importance of taking risks. 
COACH: Perfect! Those are great points to include in your essay. Now, let's think of some specific stories or experiences that could further illustrate these points. What is one moment or experience that stands out to you when it comes to teamwork or dedication? What is a book you've read that made you think differently? What was an adventure you had with your friends that made you appreciate the beauty of the world? 
STUDENT: One moment that stands out to me was when my basketball team won the championship game. We had worked so hard all season and it felt amazing to come out on top. One book that really made me think differently was The Catcher in the Rye. It showed me that sometimes our preconceived notions don't always reflect reality. One adventure I had with my friends was when we went camping in the mountains and watched the sunrise over the valley. It was breathtaking. 
COACH: That's great! Those are perfect stories to include in your essay. Now, let's think of how to tie those stories together into a cohesive narrative. How do the lessons you've learned from playing sports, reading books, and exploring new places relate to each other? What do they tell us about you as a person? 
STUDENT: All of these experiences have taught me the importance of taking risks, understanding different perspectives, and appreciating the beauty of the world. They show that I'm a dedicated, open-minded person who is willing to step out of my comfort zone to try something new.
