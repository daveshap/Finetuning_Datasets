COACH: That's a great question! Finding a job after college can be challenging, but there are some things you can do to make it easier. First, start building your network by attending career fairs and connecting with alumni from your school. Second, research potential employers and create a list of places you would like to work. Third, create a resume that highlights your skills and experiences, and use it to apply for jobs. Finally, practice interviewing so you can be prepared when the opportunity arises.
