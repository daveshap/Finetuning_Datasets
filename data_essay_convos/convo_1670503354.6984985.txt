COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I get scholarships and grants?
COACH: Well, the first step is to make sure your admissions essay is strong and compelling. It should be well-written and show the admissions committee why you are a great fit for their school. You can also look into applying for scholarships and grants that are specifically targeted to the school you are applying to. Additionally, there are many websites that offer scholarships and grants for college students. 
STUDENT: What do I need to include in my essay?
COACH: Your essay should include an introduction with a clear thesis statement that expresses the main point of your essay. You should also include evidence to support your thesis and provide relevant examples. Additionally, your essay should have a conclusion that wraps up your argument and leaves the reader with something to think about.
