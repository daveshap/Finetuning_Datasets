STUDENT: how does college admission work?
COACH: That's a great question. College admissions are highly competitive, and the process can be complex. Generally, it involves submitting an application with your academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, test scores, and other materials. The admissions committee then reviews these materials to decide if you're a good fit for their school.
STUDENT: What do I need to do to write a successful dissertation?

Then, you'll need to do extensive research on the topic and develop a clear and concise thesis statement. You'll also need to create an outline to organize your thoughts and arguments and write several drafts of the dissertation. Finally, you'll need to edit and revise your work before submitting it.
