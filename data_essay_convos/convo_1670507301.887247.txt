COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i get started writing?
COACH: Great question! A good place to start is by doing a reference interview. That means asking yourself some questions about the essay topic, like what kind of scholarship are you applying for? What are the main points you want to make in your essay? What kind of evidence or examples can you include to support your points?
Once you have a clear idea of what you want to say, you can move on to the actual writing process. First, create an outline of your essay. This will help you organize your thoughts and keep you on track. Next, write a draft of your essay. Be sure to include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Finally, revise and edit your essay to make sure it flows well and is free from any errors.
Good luck with your essay! Let me know if you need any more help.
