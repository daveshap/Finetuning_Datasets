COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: That's a great question! One way to know if your essay is good is to ask yourself if it tells a story about you. Is it specific and personal? Does it show who you are as a person?
Another way to evaluate your essay is to have someone else read it. Ask a trusted friend or family member to read it and give you feedback. It's important to get an outside opinion, especially if the essay is for a college application.
Finally, make sure that you have proofread your essay and corrected any errors. Grammar and spelling mistakes can take away from the overall quality of your essay.
STUDENT: what should i include in my essay?
COACH: When writing an essay, it's important to include specific details that will help tell your story. For example, you could include anecdotes or experiences that have shaped who you are. Think about moments that have made an impact on your life and how they have influenced your future goals.
It's also important to include evidence of your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and any other accomplishments that demonstrate your potential. Show the reader why you are a good fit for the college or university.
Finally, make sure your essay is organized and flows logically. Use transitions to help move your essay along and make sure it is clear and concise.
