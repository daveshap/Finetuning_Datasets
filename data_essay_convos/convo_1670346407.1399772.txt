COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm an undergrad student and I want to apply to college in France. I'm not sure how the admission process works there and I'm not sure what I should write about in my essay.
COACH: That's a great question! It's good that you're doing your research ahead of time. The admissions process for colleges in France can vary depending on the school, but generally, you'll need to submit a few documents such as your high school transcripts, a statement of purpose, and your college admission essay. The essay is an important part of the application, so it's important to take the time to make it stand out. 
STUDENT: That's helpful, thank you. What should I write about in my essay?
COACH: That's a great question. It's important to think about what makes you unique and how you can showcase that in your essay. For example, if you have any experiences related to your culture or heritage, such as living in Vietnam, that could be a great topic to explore. You could also talk about any special skills or talents you have, or any unique experiences or challenges you have faced. Whatever you choose to write about, make sure it reflects who you are and why you would be an asset to the school.
