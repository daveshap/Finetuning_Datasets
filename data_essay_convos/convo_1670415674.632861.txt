COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to college and I wanted to know why an admission essay matters.
COACH: An admission essay is important because it helps the college admissions staff get a better understanding of who you are as a person, beyond your grades and test scores. It allows you to tell your story and explain why you would be a great fit for their school or program. It also gives you an opportunity to showcase your writing skills and demonstrate your ability to think critically about yourself and the world around you.
STUDENT: I'm a refugee from the Philippines and I come from a single parent home. How can I make my essay stand out?
COACH: Your essay should focus on the unique experiences and challenges you have faced as a refugee and as someone coming from a single parent home. Use specific examples to illustrate how those experiences have shaped your character and outlook on life. Show how you have used these experiences to become the person you are today and how they have motivated you to pursue higher education. This will help your essay stand out from the crowd and make a positive impression on the admissions staff.
STUDENT: How can I get scholarships and grants for college?
COACH: There are numerous scholarships and grants available for students to help fund their college education. You can start by researching scholarships specifically for refugees or for students coming from single parent homes. Additionally, you can look for scholarships related to your field of study or any extracurricular activities you may have been involved in. You can also check with your high school guidance counselor or college financial aid office for more resources.
