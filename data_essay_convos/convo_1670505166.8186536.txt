COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: That's a great question! One way to make your essay more engaging is to tell a story. Rather than just listing facts, try to tell a story that illustrates why you are interested in medicine and why it matters to you. You can also use vivid descriptions of people or places to draw the reader in. Additionally, you can use humor to add life to your essay, but be careful not to overdo it. 
STUDENT: what should i avoid when writing my essay?
COACH: Great question! When writing your essay, it's important to avoid cliches and platitudes. Instead, focus on your own unique experiences and how they have shaped your interest in medicine. It's also important to avoid using overly flowery language, as it can come off as insincere. Finally, make sure to double-check your essay for any typos or grammatical errors.
