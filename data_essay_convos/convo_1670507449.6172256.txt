COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: Great question! The opening of your essay is very important. It's the first thing your reader will see and it sets the tone for your entire essay. You want to make sure your opening is engaging and captures the attention of your reader. To do this, you should focus on creating a strong thesis statement. This is a sentence that summarizes the main point or argument of your essay. It should be concise and direct, and it should be clear what position you are taking on the topic. Once you have your thesis statement, you can use it to build the rest of your essay around it.
