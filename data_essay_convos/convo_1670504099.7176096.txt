COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question. Generally, you will know your essay is finished when you have answered the prompt to the best of your ability and you have proofread and edited it for any errors. You should also make sure that your essay flows well and is organized logically. Finally, make sure that your essay conveys your unique perspective on the topic.
