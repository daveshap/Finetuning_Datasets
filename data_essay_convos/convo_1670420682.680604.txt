COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm writing an essay about my passion for social issues and travel. I'm having trouble figuring out how to structure it.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic for an essay. Can you tell me a bit more about what social issues you are passionate about and why?
STUDENT: Sure! I'm really passionate about global poverty and the environment. I believe that everyone should have access to basic resources and that we should be doing more to protect our planet. I also think travel can be a great way to learn more about different cultures and perspectives, which can help us better understand the world around us.
COACH: It sounds like you have a strong passion for these issues and that travel is an important part of your life. Can you tell me more about how you think travel can help us better understand the world?
STUDENT: Absolutely! Traveling to different countries and experiencing different cultures can really open our eyes to different perspectives and help us better understand the world around us. It can also help us appreciate our own culture and the diversity of the world. Plus, it's a great way to make connections with people from all over the world, which can help us build a better understanding of different cultures and social issues.
COACH: That's a great point! So, how do you plan to incorporate this into your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to focus on how my experiences with travel have shaped my understanding of social issues and how they have motivated me to take action. I want to talk about the different cultures I've encountered, the new perspectives I've gained, and how it has made me more aware of global poverty and environmental issues.
COACH: That sounds like a great approach! Do you have any other questions about the essay or how to structure it?
STUDENT: Yes, I was also wondering if you could explain why an admission essay matters and how financing college works?
COACH: Absolutely! An admission essay is important because it gives the admissions committee an opportunity to get to know you and your story. It's your chance to show them why you stand out from the crowd. As for financing college, there are many options available depending on your situation. You can apply for grants and scholarships, take out loans, or look into work-study programs. It's important to do your research and find the best option for you.
