COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm writing an essay and I'm not sure where to start.
COACH: That's a great question. Before you get started, let's talk about the parts of an essay. An essay typically has an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. The introduction is the hook, or the part that draws the reader in. The body is the middle of the essay, where you provide evidence and arguments to support your topic. Finally, the conclusion is the part where you summarize and tie up any loose ends. Does that make sense?
STUDENT: Yes, that makes sense. But I'm still not sure what I should write about in my personal statement.
COACH: That's a great question. When it comes to personal statements, it's important to think about what makes you unique and what experiences have shaped who you are today. Think about your background, your values, and your goals. What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced in your life? How have you grown and changed as a result? These are all good topics to explore in your personal statement. 
STUDENT: Okay, that's helpful. I'm also interested in writing about Islam, but I'm not sure how to approach it.
COACH: Well, when it comes to writing about Islam, it's important to be aware of the cultural context and to do your research. Make sure that you're familiar with the history and culture of the religion, and try to find a unique angle or perspective that you can bring to the topic. Consider how you can use your own experiences to inform your writing, and focus on telling a story that will engage the reader.
