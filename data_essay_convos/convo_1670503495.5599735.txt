COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question! When writing your college admissions essay, you should focus on why you want to attend the college you are applying to, what makes you stand out from other applicants, and how you plan to use your college experience to pursue a career after graduation. You can also discuss any experiences you have had that have prepared you for the next step in your education.
