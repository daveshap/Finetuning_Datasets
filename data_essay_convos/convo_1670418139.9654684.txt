COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm struggling with my admissions essay. I don't know what to write about and I'm not sure why it matters.
COACH: That's understandable. An admissions essay is an important part of your application because it allows the admissions committee to get a better understanding of who you are as a person. It's a chance for you to share your story, your passions, and your goals. Tell me a bit more about yourself and what you're interested in. 
STUDENT: Well, I'm not particularly interesting as a person. I'm a good student, I'm involved in some extracurriculars and volunteer work, but nothing too exciting.
COACH: That's ok! You don't need to be a wild and exciting person to have a great admissions essay. It's more important to show the admissions committee that you are passionate about something, and that you are driven to make a difference in whatever way you can. Can you think of any areas in which you excel or have a special interest in? 
STUDENT: I'm really interested in history and literature. I enjoy reading and researching different topics, and I'm fascinated by the way people lived in the past.
COACH: That sounds great! You could use your admissions essay to explain why you are so interested in history and literature, and how that has shaped your goals and aspirations. You could also discuss any specific experiences you have had that have furthered your interest in these subjects. 
STUDENT: Okay, so what would the structure of the essay be like?
COACH: That's a great question! Most essays follow a basic structure of introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction should provide some context and background information, and should include a hook that will capture the reader's attention. The body should be the main focus of your essay, and should include several paragraphs that discuss your experiences, interests, and goals. Finally, the conclusion should summarize your points and provide a strong ending to your essay.
