COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to law school and I'm having difficulty writing my essay. I'm not sure what admissions officers look for in an essay.
COACH: That's a great question! Admissions officers are looking for a few key elements when they read your essay. First, they want to see that you can write in a clear and concise manner. They want to be able to understand your thoughts and arguments easily. Second, they want to get a sense of who you are as a person and how you think. Third, they want to see that you can make a strong argument and support it with evidence. Finally, they want to make sure that the essay is free of any typos or grammatical errors.
STUDENT: Okay, that's helpful. What about the structure of an essay? Is there a specific format I should follow?
COACH: Yes, there is a general structure that most essays follow. It typically includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction is your chance to grab the reader's attention and explain the purpose of your essay. The body paragraphs are where you make your argument and provide evidence to support it. The conclusion is where you wrap up your argument and provide a final thought. It's also important to make sure that your essay flows logically from one point to the next.
STUDENT: That makes sense. I'm writing about sexism in the legal profession and how it has impacted my life. Do I need to include a hook in my introduction?
COACH: Absolutely! A hook is a great way to draw the reader in and make them want to keep reading. It can be a quote, a statistic, or a personal anecdote. Whatever you choose, make sure it's relevant to the topic and engaging. You can also use the hook to introduce the main idea of your essay.
