COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi. I'm writing a personal statement for college admissions and I'm not sure what to include or how to make it stand out.
COACH: That's a great question! First, let me ask you a few questions to better understand your needs. What do you think admissions officers are looking for in an essay?
STUDENT: Well, I think they want to see that I'm a good fit for the school, that I'm passionate about the subject I'm studying, and that I'm a well-rounded person.
COACH: That's a great answer! To add on to that, admissions officers are also looking for students who can think critically, have a strong sense of self, and demonstrate an ability to learn and grow. It's also important to show that you have a clear understanding of why attending this particular school is important to you and how it will help you reach your goals.
Now, why do you think an admission essay matters?
STUDENT: I think an admission essay matters because it gives admissions officers a chance to get to know you outside of your grades and test scores. It allows them to see the person behind the numbers and gain insight into who you are as an individual.
COACH: That's exactly right! An admission essay is an opportunity for you to showcase your unique skills, experiences, and perspectives. It's also a way for you to demonstrate your commitment to the school and its values.
Finally, do you have any special considerations, such as neurodiversity, that you'd like to highlight in your essay?
STUDENT: Yes, I do. I'm neurodiverse and I think it's important to mention this in my essay. I want to show admissions officers that I'm comfortable with my differences and that I'm capable of succeeding despite them.
COACH: Absolutely! Your essay is an opportunity to share your story and highlight your strengths, including your neurodiversity. You can talk about how your unique perspective has shaped your life and how it will contribute to the school community. Show admissions officers that you are an interesting person who can bring something special to their school.
