STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: A good way to make your essay shorter is to focus on the main points you want to get across and omit any unnecessary details. Make sure that each sentence serves a purpose and that it is relevant to the overall theme of your essay. You can also look for any overly wordy sentences and rephrase them in a more concise way. Additionally, you can try to combine multiple sentences into one if they are related. Finally, you can look for any words or phrases that are repeated and see if you can eliminate them.
