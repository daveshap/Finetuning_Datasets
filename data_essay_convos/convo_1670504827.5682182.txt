COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: That's a great question! You can start by cutting out any unnecessary words, phrases, or sentences. Try to focus on the main points of your essay and make sure that each sentence is contributing something meaningful to the overall message. You can also consider summarizing some of your points instead of going into too much detail. Finally, make sure that you are using active language and concise sentences. This will help you get your point across without using more words than necessary.
