COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking to apply to MIT for their undergraduate engineering program and I'm wondering how to go about writing my essay.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a passion for engineering and are really interested in attending MIT. Before we get into the specifics of your essay, can you tell me a bit more about your background? What have you been doing to prepare for college?
STUDENT: Sure. I've been taking advanced math and science classes for the past few years and I'm also involved in a few extracurricular activities, such as robotics club and debate team.
COACH: Excellent! It sounds like you have a lot of experience and have been preparing for college for a while. Now, let's talk more specifically about the college admissions process and what you need to do to write a successful essay. How much do you know about how college admission works?
STUDENT: Not too much, to be honest. I know that essays are an important part of the application process, but I don't know what kind of essay I should write or what topics to focus on.
COACH: No problem! The first thing you should do is research the school you're applying to. Read up on the school's mission statement, its values, and its programs. Knowing this information will help you craft an essay that speaks to the school's values and interests. Once you have a better understanding of the school, you can start brainstorming essay topics and ideas. Think about what makes you stand out from other applicants and what qualities you possess that would make you a great addition to the school. Also, consider your experiences and how they have shaped your outlook on life and your academic goals. These are all great topics to explore in your essay.
