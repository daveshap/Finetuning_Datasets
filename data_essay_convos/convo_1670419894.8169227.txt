COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to figure out what to write about for my college essay. I'm interested in a lot of different things and I'm having trouble narrowing down my focus.
COACH: Okay, that's understandable. Can you tell me a bit more about the topics you're interested in?
STUDENT: Sure, I'm really passionate about Buddhism and I'm also very creative. I love art and I'm also interested in science.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of interests. Have you thought about how you could combine some of these interests in your essay?
STUDENT: I haven't, but I think it could be a good idea. I'm applying to Duke University, so I'm not sure if they would be interested in something like that.
COACH: Absolutely! Duke University is known for its interdisciplinary approach, so combining some of your interests could be a great way to stand out in your essay. You could talk about how your creativity and passion for Buddhism have enabled you to explore different aspects of science and art. 
STUDENT: Okay, that sounds like a good idea. I think it could be really interesting to explore how those different aspects of my life intersect.
COACH: Definitely! You could use your essay to show how your different interests have shaped you as a person and how they have helped you to become the person you are today. It could be a great way to demonstrate your passion for learning and exploring new ideas.
