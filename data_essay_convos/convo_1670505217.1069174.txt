COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: A great way to make your essay engaging is to use vivid language, include interesting details, and tell a story. For example, instead of just saying that you volunteered at a local soup kitchen, tell a story about the people you met and how it changed your perspective. This will help draw in your reader and make them want to learn more.
Another way to make your essay more engaging is to be creative with your structure. Instead of writing a traditional five-paragraph essay, experiment with different formats such as a narrative or a list. This will help keep your reader interested and engaged.
Finally, don't forget to proofread your essay for any typos or errors. A well-written and error-free essay will be more engaging and make a better impression on the reader.
