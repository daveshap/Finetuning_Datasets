COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do I write about in my personal statement?
COACH: Well, that depends on the prompt. Do you have the prompt in front of you?
STUDENT: Yes, the prompt is “Describe a time when you overcame a challenge.”
COACH: Great, so you'll want to focus your essay around that topic. Start by thinking about an experience you had where you faced a challenge and overcame it. Think about how it made you feel, what you learned from it, and how it has impacted your life.
Once you have an experience in mind, start brainstorming ideas for your essay. What details can you include to make it interesting and engaging? What themes or messages do you want to communicate?
Once you have an idea of what to write about, you can start writing. Make sure to keep your essay organized and focused on the main message. Don't be afraid to use humor or emotion, but make sure your essay still reads as professional.
Finally, remember to proofread your essay. Make sure there are no spelling or grammar mistakes and that your essay flows logically.
Good luck with your essay!
