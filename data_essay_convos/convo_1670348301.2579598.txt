COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a college student and I'm applying to universities in Germany. I need help with my college admission essay.
COACH: Great, let's start by talking about your background. Where are you from and what have you been doing since high school?
STUDENT: I'm from the United States and I've been studying science and taking some volunteer work.
COACH: That's great! You have a lot of experience to draw on then. What kind of science have you been studying?
STUDENT: I've been studying biology, chemistry, and physics.
COACH: Great! So you have a strong foundation in the sciences. What do you think you could write about in your essay that would show off your expertise in these areas?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I want to make sure that my essay stands out from other applicants.
COACH: Absolutely. One thing you can do is focus on a specific topic or research project that you've done in one of those fields. Talk about the results you found and how it made you think differently about the subject. That will show the admissions committee that you have a deep understanding of the field.
You can also talk about any volunteer work you've done that relates to the sciences. Showing that you have a passion for the subject and have taken the initiative to get involved will make your essay stand out.
STUDENT: That's a great idea! I think I can make a really strong essay now.
COACH: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with?
STUDENT: Actually, I was wondering how I can find a job after college in Germany.
COACH: That's a great question. There are a few things you can do to increase your chances of finding a job after college. First, make sure you have a strong resume and cover letter. Employers in Germany tend to be very focused on qualifications and experience, so make sure you highlight any relevant skills or experience you have.
Second, network with people in the industry. Use LinkedIn to connect with people who work in the field you're interested in, and attend networking events. This will give you an opportunity to make connections and learn more about the job market in Germany.
Finally, consider internships. Many employers in Germany look for interns, so this could be a great way to gain experience and make connections.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. Thank you so much for your advice!
