COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question! Before you start writing your essay, it's important to think about what kind of job you want after college. What interests you? What kind of skills do you have that you could use in the job market? Once you know what kind of job you want, you can start to focus your essay around that goal. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you could talk about your dedication to helping people and how you plan to use your degree to make a difference in the world.
