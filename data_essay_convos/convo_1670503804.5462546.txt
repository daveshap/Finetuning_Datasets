COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should summarize the main points of your essay and provide a sense of closure. It should also emphasize the importance of the topic and the implications of your argument. Try to restate the thesis in a different way and draw a conclusion based on the evidence you have presented.
