STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question. Before we answer that, can you tell me a bit more about the essay? What type of essay is it?
STUDENT: It's a personal statement for law school.
COACH: Okay, great. Now, when it comes to writing a personal statement for law school, the most important thing is to make sure you include the key points that will demonstrate why you are a good fit for that particular school. You should also make sure that your essay is well-structured, with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Once you have all of this in place, you can start to refine and edit your essay to make sure it is as polished and professional as possible. When you feel like you have done all that you can to make your essay the best it can be, then it is finished.
