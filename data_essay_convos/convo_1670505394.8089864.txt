STUDENT: how do scholarships work?
COACH: Scholarships are monetary awards given to students based on academic, athletic, or artistic merit. They are usually awarded by universities or other organizations and can be used to cover tuition costs and other expenses. To apply for scholarships, you'll need to submit an application and provide documentation of your academic performance, extracurricular activities, and other qualifications.
