COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i apply for grants?
COACH: Grants are typically awarded based on financial need or academic merit. You may be eligible for certain grants based on your financial situation, so it's important to research the different grants available and determine if you meet the criteria. Additionally, some grants may require you to write an essay as part of the application process. The essay should explain why you are a good candidate for the grant and how you plan to use the funds.
