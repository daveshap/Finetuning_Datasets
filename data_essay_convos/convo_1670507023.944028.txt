COACH: Well, the best way to make an essay engaging is to focus on a topic that you are passionate about and that you have a strong opinion on. Additionally, it's important to use vivid language and create a narrative that draws the reader in. You can also use interesting anecdotes, quotes, and other relevant evidence to support your argument and make it more engaging.
