COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm applying to Yale for undergrad. I'm interested in studying science, but I'm not sure how to get started on my essay.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of ambition and drive. It can be intimidating to write an essay for such a prestigious school, but with the right guidance, you can do it. Let's start by talking about your background and what has inspired you to pursue a career in science. 
STUDENT: Well, I've always been interested in science since I was a kid. I remember my dad taking me to the planetarium and that made me really curious about the universe. I also took a lot of science classes in high school and did well in them, so I think I have a solid foundation.
COACH: That's excellent! It sounds like you have a strong passion for science and a good base of knowledge. That will come in handy when it comes to writing your essay. Now let's talk about what makes you unique and how you can stand out as an applicant. What sets you apart from other students?
STUDENT: Well, I think one of the things that sets me apart is that I'm a first-generation college student. My parents didn't go to college, so I'm the first in my family to pursue higher education. I'm also a minority, which I think gives me a different perspective on the world.
COACH: That's great! Those are both excellent points that you can use to your advantage. You can highlight how your unique background has shaped your interests and ambitions, and how it has motivated you to pursue a career in science. You can also discuss how your experiences as a minority have influenced your outlook and how you view the world. This will make your essay stand out and show the admissions committee that you're a unique and interesting candidate.
