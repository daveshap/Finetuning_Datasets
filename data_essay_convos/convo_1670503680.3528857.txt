COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i get started writing?
COACH: The best way to get started is to brainstorm ideas. Think about your experiences, values, and goals, and how they relate to the law school you are applying to. Once you have some ideas, you can start to organize them into an outline. That way, you'll have a plan for what to include in the essay.
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: Your essay should be personal and unique to you. Focus on why you want to attend law school and what makes you stand out as a candidate. Also, don't forget to include any relevant experiences or accomplishments that demonstrate your commitment to the field of law. Finally, you should also explain why you are a good fit for the specific law school you are applying to.
STUDENT: How do I make sure my essay stands out?
COACH: To make your essay stand out, you should use vivid language and storytelling techniques to draw the reader in. Focus on creating a narrative that is engaging and memorable. Make sure to avoid cliches and jargon, and instead use specific details to paint a picture of who you are and why you are passionate about law. Additionally, proofread your essay multiple times to ensure that it is free from typos and errors.
