COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: That's a great question! To make your essay more engaging, start by considering the audience you are writing for. What do you want them to take away from your essay? What kind of impression do you want to make? Once you have a clear idea of that, you can use descriptive language and creative anecdotes to draw the reader in and illustrate your points. You can also use storytelling techniques to make your essay more interesting and memorable.
