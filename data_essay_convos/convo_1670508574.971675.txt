COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I apply for scholarships?
COACH: That's a great question! Applying for scholarships can be a bit of a process, so let's break it down. First, you'll want to research the different types of scholarships that are available and figure out which ones you qualify for. Then, you'll need to fill out the application forms and submit them. Finally, you'll need to write an essay that clearly demonstrates your qualifications and why you should receive the scholarship.
Now, let's talk about your monograph essay. What is the topic you are writing about?
STUDENT: I'm writing about the history of the feminist movement in the United States.
COACH: Great! Before you start writing, it's important to do some research. You'll want to look into the different events and people that have shaped the feminist movement in the US, as well as any relevant laws or policies. Once you have a good understanding of the topic, you can start to form an argument. Make sure you include evidence from your research to back up your points. Finally, don't forget to proofread your essay before submitting it!
