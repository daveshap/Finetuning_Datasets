COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i apply for grants?
COACH: Grants are a great way to fund your education, but that isn't exactly what I can help you with. What kind of essay are you working on?
STUDENT: I'm trying to write a thesis essay.
COACH: That's great! Thesis essays are a great way to make an argument and support it with evidence. Let's start by talking about your topic. What is the focus of your essay? 
STUDENT: My essay is about the importance of financial literacy in the modern world.
COACH: Great! That's an interesting topic. Now let's talk about the structure of your essay. What kind of structure do you think would work best for your essay? 
STUDENT: I'm not sure.
COACH: That's okay. A good structure for a thesis essay is to start with an introduction that outlines the main points of your argument. Then, you can have three body paragraphs that each discuss a different point in more detail. Finally, you can end with a conclusion that ties all of your points together and provides a summary of your argument. Does that sound like something you could use for your essay?
