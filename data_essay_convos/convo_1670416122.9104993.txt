COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UCLA for my undergrad and I'm having trouble writing my essay. I'm not sure what admissions officers are looking for.
COACH: That's a great question. Admissions officers are looking for a few things. First, they want to see that you have the skills and achievements necessary to be successful in college. They will also look at your volunteer work and extracurricular activities to get an idea of your commitment to learning. Finally, they want to see that you can write a compelling essay that stands out from the rest.
STUDENT: Okay, so what should I focus on when writing my essay?
COACH: When writing your essay, focus on your strengths and what makes you unique. What sets you apart from other applicants? What experiences have you had that have shaped who you are today? Have you faced any challenges or obstacles that you have overcome? These are all things that admissions officers will be looking for in your essay. Also, make sure to showcase your writing skills. Make sure that your essay is well-structured and flows logically. Finally, don't forget to proofread your essay for any grammar or spelling errors.
