COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I get scholarships and grants?
COACH: Well, the best way to get scholarships and grants is to write a strong personal statement. That's why I'm here. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to accomplish with your essay?
STUDENT: I want to be able to showcase my personality and interests in a way that will make me stand out from other applicants.
COACH: That's a great goal! Let's start by looking at the structure of a successful personal statement. It should have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. The introduction should provide an overview of who you are and why you're writing the essay. The body should provide evidence that supports your argument and explain why you're a good fit for the scholarship or grant. Finally, the conclusion should summarize your main points and leave the reader with a lasting impression. Does that make sense? 
STUDENT: Yes, that makes sense.
COACH: Great! Now let's talk about the content of your essay. What are some of your unique qualities that you'd like to highlight? What experiences have shaped who you are today? 
STUDENT: Well, I'm a very creative person and I love to explore new ideas. I'm also very passionate about helping others and making a difference in my community. I've had a lot of experiences that have shaped me, like volunteering with different organizations and taking part in different leadership roles. 
COACH: Those are all great qualities and experiences that you can draw upon for your essay. Now, let's focus on how to write about them. What kind of language will you use to express your thoughts and feelings? How will you make sure your essay is engaging and interesting for the reader? 
STUDENT: I think I'll use vivid and descriptive language to show my enthusiasm and passion for my experiences. I also want to make sure I'm using language that is clear and concise so that the reader can easily understand my message.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan! Now, let's talk about how to organize your essay. What order will you use to present your points? What themes will you use to tie your essay together? 
STUDENT: I think I'll start by introducing myself and my background, then move into discussing my experiences and how they have shaped me. I'll end by talking about my goals and how I plan to use the scholarship or grant to achieve them. I want to emphasize the importance of service and how it has made me a better person.
COACH: Perfect! Now that you have a plan for your essay, let's go over the editing process. What steps do you plan to take to make sure your essay is polished and error-free? 
STUDENT: I plan to read through my essay multiple times, paying special attention to grammar and spelling mistakes. I'll also have a few friends or family members read it and give me feedback. Finally, I'll use online resources like grammar checkers to make sure everything is perfect.
