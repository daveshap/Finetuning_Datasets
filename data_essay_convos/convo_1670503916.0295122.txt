COACH: Well, the most important thing to focus on when writing a college admissions essay is to make sure it reflects your unique personality and experiences. You should also make sure that you have a clear thesis statement that you can refer back to throughout the essay. Additionally, it's important to make sure that your essay is well-structured with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Finally, make sure that you proofread your essay and that it is free of any grammar or spelling errors.
