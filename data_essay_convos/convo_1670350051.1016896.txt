COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for advice on how to get scholarships and grants. My family is not very well off, so I'm hoping to be able to use my essay to help me get some financial aid.
COACH: That's a great goal! It's definitely possible to use your essay to get financial aid, but it's going to take some careful planning. First, let's talk about what you're going to write about in your personal statement. What are some of the things that are important to you?
STUDENT: Well, I'm very passionate about my faith. I'm Christian, and I want to be able to express that in my essay. I also think it's important to talk about why college matters to me and how it can help me reach my goals.
COACH: Absolutely! Religion is an important part of who you are, and it's important to express that in your essay. You can talk about the values that you have, the lessons that you've learned, and how it has shaped your outlook on life. You can also talk about why college matters to you and how it can help you achieve your goals. For example, if you want to pursue a career in a certain field, you can discuss how college will help you gain the knowledge and skills you need to succeed.
