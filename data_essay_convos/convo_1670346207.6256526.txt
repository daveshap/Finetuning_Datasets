COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing a personal statement for college and I'm struggling with it. 
COACH: Alright, let's start by understanding what you're trying to convey in your essay. What is the main message you want to get across?
STUDENT: I want to talk about my experience growing up in China and how I overcame racism and other obstacles to get to where I am today.
COACH: Okay, that sounds like a great topic. Can you tell me more about your experience with racism and the challenges you faced?
STUDENT: Well, growing up in China, I was often the target of racial slurs and discrimination. I had to learn to be resilient and develop a thick skin to deal with these issues.
COACH: That must have been difficult. How did you manage to stay positive and keep going despite all of these challenges?
STUDENT: I think it was a combination of my family's support and my own determination to succeed. My parents were always encouraging and supportive, and I knew that I had to work hard and persevere if I wanted to achieve my goals.
COACH: That's great. It sounds like you have a lot of strength and determination. What advice would you give to other students who are facing similar obstacles?
STUDENT: I would tell them to never give up and to believe in themselves. It can be hard to stay positive when dealing with racism and other forms of discrimination, but it's important to remember that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
COACH: That's wonderful advice. Now, let's talk about how you can use your experiences to create a compelling personal statement. What do you think is the most important thing to include in your essay?
STUDENT: I think it's important to focus on how I've grown and changed as a person because of my experiences. I want to show how I've used the challenges I faced to become a better and stronger person.
COACH: That's an excellent point. Can you give me an example of how you've grown and developed through your experiences?
STUDENT: Sure. One example is that I now have a greater appreciation for diversity and cultural differences. Growing up in China, I was exposed to many different cultures and beliefs, and this has made me more open-minded and tolerant of others.
COACH: That's great. How else do you think your experiences have shaped you?
STUDENT: I also think that my experiences have made me more resilient and determined. I know that I can overcome any obstacle or challenge if I put my mind to it. I'm not afraid to take risks and try new things, and I'm confident in my ability to succeed.
