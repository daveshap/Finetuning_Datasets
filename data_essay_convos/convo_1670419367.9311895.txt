COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm a first generation college student applying to med school and I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about in my personal statement.
COACH: That's a great question! Can you tell me more about your background? What experiences have shaped you into the person you are today?
STUDENT: Well, I'm from a Vietnamese family and my parents immigrated to the US when I was very young. Growing up, I was exposed to a lot of traditional values and customs, but I also had the opportunity to experience a different culture. My family has always been very supportive of my goals and dreams, so I'm very grateful for that. I'm also part of the LGBT community, which has been a huge part of my identity and has helped me to become a more compassionate and understanding person.
COACH: Wow, that's quite a journey! You have so many amazing experiences to draw from in your personal statement. What do you think would be the most important aspects of your life that you want to highlight?
STUDENT: I think I want to focus on my family's influence and how it has shaped me into the person I am today. I also want to talk about how my experiences as a member of the LGBT community have made me more compassionate and understanding of others. Finally, I want to emphasize how my dedication and commitment to achieving my goals has driven me to pursue a career in medicine.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan! So, now that you know what you want to focus on, how can I help you to craft an effective and compelling personal statement?
STUDENT: I'm not sure where to start. Could you give me some advice on how to structure my essay and make it stand out?
COACH: Absolutely! First, I recommend that you start by telling a story about a significant event or experience that shaped your view of the world. Once you have that story down, you can begin to weave in the other key elements of your life that you want to emphasize. Make sure to also include any obstacles you faced along the way and how you overcame them. Finally, end with a strong conclusion that ties together all of the themes in your essay.
