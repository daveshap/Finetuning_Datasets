COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admission essay matters because it gives you the opportunity to show a college admissions committee who you are and why you would be a great fit for their school. It allows you to share your story, personality, and accomplishments in a way that grades and test scores can't. It also helps the admissions committee get to know you better, which can help them make an informed decision about your application.
