COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question! When it comes to writing a college admissions essay, you should focus on a few key points. First, explain why you're interested in the program you're applying to and what you hope to gain from it. Then, discuss any relevant skills or experiences you have that make you a good fit for the program. Finally, talk about your career goals and how the program can help you achieve them. This will give the admissions committee a better understanding of who you are and why you're a great candidate.
