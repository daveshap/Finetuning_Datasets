COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question. The best way to know when your essay is finished is to make sure it has all the necessary components. An argumentative essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Your introduction should include an attention-grabbing hook and a thesis statement. Each body paragraph should have a topic sentence, evidence to support your argument, and an analysis of how the evidence supports your argument. Finally, your conclusion should summarize your argument and provide a call to action. Once you have all of these components, you can be sure that your essay is finished.
