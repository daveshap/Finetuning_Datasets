COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm writing an essay about my experiences growing up in a single parent home and how it shaped my views on Islam, sexism, and why college matters to me.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting topic! Could you tell me more about your background and what inspired you to write about this?
STUDENT: Sure. Growing up in a single parent home, I was raised with a strong sense of Islamic values and beliefs. I saw firsthand how sexism and gender inequality can affect people's lives, and I wanted to explore the impact of those issues on my own life and how they have informed my views on why college matters to me.
COACH: That's very insightful. What do you think are the most important aspects of your experience that you want to highlight in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to focus on how growing up in a single parent home has shaped my views on Islam, sexism, and why college matters to me. I also want to discuss my goals and personal objectives for attending college and how it will help me achieve my dreams.
COACH: Great! It sounds like you have a clear vision for your essay. What kind of research have you done to support your points?
STUDENT: I've been doing a lot of research on the topics of Islam, sexism, and why college matters. I've also been reading up on stories from other single parent homes to get a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with growing up in this type of family structure. 
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you're doing a lot of research and gathering a lot of information to support your points. Are there any specific areas where you feel like you need extra help or guidance?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm having a bit of trouble organizing all of my thoughts into a cohesive essay. I'm not sure how to structure my essay or how to make sure my points are clear and easy to follow.
COACH: No problem! We can work together to create an outline that will help you organize your thoughts and ideas. Then, we can look at how to structure and format your essay so that it flows well and is easy to read. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?
STUDENT: Absolutely! That sounds like a great plan.
