COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about my experience growing up as a Muslim in France, and why college matters to me.
STUDENT: I want to apply to UCLA, so I want to make sure my essay stands out.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic. Could you tell me more about it? What experiences have shaped your perspective on why college matters?
STUDENT: Sure. Growing up in France, I was exposed to different cultures and beliefs. I saw how education could open doors for people that would otherwise be closed. Education was valued highly in my community, and it was always stressed to us that if we wanted to succeed, we needed to pursue higher education. 
At the same time, I also saw how my Muslim faith was often misunderstood or misrepresented in the media. I began to understand the importance of having a voice and being able to share my story. College seemed like the perfect platform for me to do that. 
COACH: That's a great story. It sounds like you have a strong understanding of why college matters and how it can open up opportunities for you. What else do you think is important to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I also want to talk about my experience as an LGBT person in France. I know that the LGBT community faces a lot of discrimination and stigma, and I want to use my essay to show that I'm not afraid to stand up for what I believe in.
COACH: That's a very powerful message. It sounds like you have a lot of experiences and perspectives to share in your essay. I think it's important to focus on how these experiences have shaped who you are today and how they will help you succeed in college.
