COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: That's a great question. Before we dive into the specifics of writing an opening, let me ask you some questions to get a better understanding of what you're trying to accomplish with your essay. What is the focus of your essay? What do you want to communicate to your readers?
STUDENT: I want to communicate that I am a hardworking and determined individual who is passionate about learning and exploring new things.
COACH: That sounds great! Now, let's talk about how to capture that in your opening. An effective opening should grab the reader's attention and set the tone for the rest of the essay. You can do this by introducing yourself as a person, sharing a personal story, or giving a strong opinion. Whichever approach you choose, make sure it reflects your personality and the main points you want to make.
