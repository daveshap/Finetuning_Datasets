COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I pick a topic?
COACH: That's a great question! It's important to pick a topic that you are passionate about and that you feel comfortable writing about. You should also consider what the admissions committee is looking for in an essay. Think about topics that can showcase your strengths, accomplishments, and unique perspective. Once you have chosen a topic, you can start to develop your thesis statement, which will be the main focus of your essay.
