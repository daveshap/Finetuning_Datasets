COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about my travels to Thailand and how it has impacted my views on Buddhism.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting topic! Could you tell me a bit more about your travels and why you chose to focus on Buddhism?
STUDENT: Sure. I had the opportunity to travel to Thailand last year and it was a really eye-opening experience. I was exposed to Buddhist culture and teachings for the first time, and it made me think about my own beliefs and values in a different way. I was intrigued by the idea of living a life of mindfulness and decided to focus my essay on that.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot to say about your experiences in Thailand. What kind of structure are you thinking of for your essay?
STUDENT: I'm thinking of starting with a brief overview of my journey to Thailand, then going into detail about the Buddhist temples I visited and how they influenced my perspective. Finally, I want to discuss how this newfound understanding of Buddhism has impacted my life since returning home.
COACH: That's a great plan! What kind of research have you done so far? Have you read any books or articles on the subject?
STUDENT: Yes, I've read quite a few books and articles, both on Buddhism in general and on my specific experiences in Thailand. I've also talked to some of my friends who have traveled to other Buddhist countries like China and Europe to get their perspectives.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a good foundation for your essay. Are there any particular challenges you're facing with the writing process?
STUDENT: Well, I'm having trouble figuring out how to make my essay engaging and interesting. I want to make sure I don't just write a boring list of facts, but I'm not sure how to do that.
COACH: That's a common challenge for many writers. One way to make your essay more engaging is to include personal anecdotes and stories from your travels. This will help bring your essay to life and make it more interesting to read. You can also use vivid language and imagery to describe your experiences and evoke emotion in the reader.
