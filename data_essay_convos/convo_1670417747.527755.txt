COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about my experience travelling to Thailand and how it has impacted my perception of politics.
COACH: That sounds like a fascinating topic! Can you tell me a bit more about your experience in Thailand?
STUDENT: Sure! I spent a month in Bangkok, exploring the city and learning about the culture and politics. I was particularly interested in the role of the monarchy and how that has shaped the country's history.
COACH: That's really interesting! What did you learn about the monarchy and its impact on the country?
STUDENT: Well, I learned that the monarchy has had a huge influence on the politics and culture of Thailand. The King is seen as a symbol of unity and stability, and his decisions are respected and followed by the people.
COACH: That's really interesting. How has your experience in Thailand impacted your view of politics?
STUDENT: It has made me realize that politics is not just about the laws and regulations, but also about the people and their culture. I also understand that different countries have different ways of dealing with political issues, and that it's important to understand the context in which they operate. For example, I now understand why the Thai people are so loyal to the monarchy and why they follow the King's decisions.
COACH: That's a great insight! What else have you learned from your travels and how do you plan to use this knowledge in your essay?
STUDENT: I've learned a lot about different cultures and how they interact with each other. I plan to use this knowledge to compare and contrast different political systems, such as those in Europe and the United States. I also plan to use my experience in Thailand to discuss how different cultures can find common ground when it comes to politics. Finally, I plan to use my knowledge of the Thai political system to discuss how the monarchy has been able to maintain stability and unity in the country.
