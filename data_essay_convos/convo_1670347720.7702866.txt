COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm an undergrad applying to Duke University and I'm having trouble writing my essay. I'm trying to write about how my creativity and art have been influenced by my experiences in Europe, but I'm not sure how to make it interesting since I don't feel like I'm particularly interesting as a person.
COACH: That's a great topic! Let's start by talking about your experiences in Europe. What were some of the places you visited and what did you learn from them?
STUDENT: I visited several countries in Europe, including Italy, France, and Germany. I was really inspired by the art and architecture I saw in each place, especially the Renaissance art in Italy. I also noticed how each country had its own unique culture, which helped me understand the importance of preserving cultural heritage.
COACH: That's really interesting! It sounds like you had some wonderful experiences in Europe that really shaped your creative outlook. Now let's talk about how you can use those experiences to make your essay stand out. What do you think makes you unique as a person that could be highlighted in your essay?
STUDENT: I think one thing that makes me unique is my ability to appreciate different cultures. I think this has helped me to be open-minded and creative when it comes to my artwork. I also think that my experience in Europe has given me a greater appreciation for the beauty of the world around me, which I try to capture in my artwork.
COACH: That's a great point! You can definitely use this to your advantage in your essay. Think about how you could incorporate these experiences into your essay to make it more interesting and personal. Maybe you could talk about how your travels have shaped your view of the world and how it has impacted your artwork. This could be a great way to show the admissions committee your unique perspective.
