COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm an undergrad student and I'm struggling to write an essay about racism in Christianity. I'm having trouble finding a unique angle to make it engaging.
COACH: That's a great topic for an essay and it can be quite engaging if you approach it the right way. What elements of racism in Christianity would you like to focus on?
STUDENT: Well, I'm interested in exploring how racism has been used as a tool of oppression by those in power.
COACH: That's a great idea. You could start by researching the history of racism in Christianity, looking at how it has been used to justify oppressive behaviors. You could also explore how Christianity has been used to combat racism, looking at people and organizations that have used their faith to fight against racism.
STUDENT: That sounds great. But I'm still feeling a bit lost on how to make the essay engaging.
COACH: A great way to make your essay engaging is to use personal stories or anecdotes. Try to think of any experiences or stories you may have that relate to your topic. You could also interview people who have experienced racism in the Christian faith and use their stories to illustrate your points. Additionally, you could look for current events or news stories related to racism and Christianity that you could use to bring your essay to life.
