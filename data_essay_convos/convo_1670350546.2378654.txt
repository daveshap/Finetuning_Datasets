COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay for a college application and I'm having trouble figuring out how to start.
COACH: That's understandable! Before we dive into the essay, why don't you tell me a bit about yourself and your goals?
STUDENT: Sure. My name is John and I'm from Thailand. I'm a Muslim and I'm interested in studying international relations. My goal is to attend a prestigious university and eventually work in the diplomatic corps.
COACH: That's a great ambition! What kind of obstacles have you faced in pursuing your goals?
STUDENT: Well, I've been rejected from a few universities before and it has been really difficult to deal with the rejection. It's made me doubt my abilities and question whether I'm good enough to pursue my dream.
COACH: Rejection can be hard to cope with, but it doesn't mean that you're not capable of achieving your goals. Have you taken any steps to overcome these obstacles?
STUDENT: Yes, I've been working hard to improve my grades and I'm also doing research on different universities to find out which ones are the best fit for me.
COACH: That's great! Now let's talk about your essay. What do you want to focus on in your essay? What are your personal objectives for writing it?
STUDENT: I want to focus on my experiences as a Muslim in Thailand and how they have shaped my views on international relations. I also want to show the admissions committee that I am determined and resilient in the face of adversity.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! How do you plan to structure your essay?
STUDENT: I was thinking of starting off by talking about my background and then transitioning into how my upbringing has shaped my views on international relations. I want to end the essay by talking about how I'm determined to pursue my goals despite facing rejection.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan! Do you need help with the writing process or do you just need some guidance on how to start?
STUDENT: I think I could use some help with the writing process. I'm not sure how to make my essay stand out and I'm afraid of making mistakes.
COACH: Don't worry, I'm here to help! Let's start by brainstorming some ideas and then we can work on refining your essay.
