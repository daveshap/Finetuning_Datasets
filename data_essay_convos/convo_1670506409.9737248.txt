COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do I write about in my personal statement?
COACH: A personal statement is an opportunity for you to share your story and experiences that make you unique. Before we dive into the essay, can you tell me a bit about yourself? What have been some of your biggest accomplishments or challenges you've faced in life?
STUDENT: Well, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm the first in my family to go to college. It's been a huge challenge for me because I didn't have any guidance or support from my family. I had to figure out how to get into college and how to pay for it on my own. But I was determined to make it happen. I worked hard and got good grades in high school, and I was able to get scholarships and grants to help pay for college.
COACH: That's an incredible accomplishment! It's clear that you have the determination and resilience to overcome any obstacle. Now, let's focus on how you can use this experience to write your admissions essay. Think about how this experience has shaped you as a person and how it has impacted your outlook on life. What values have you learned from this experience? How has it made you a better person? These are the kinds of things you should focus on in your essay.
