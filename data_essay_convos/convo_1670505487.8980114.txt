STUDENT: how do I apply for scholarships?
COACH: Well, the best way to apply for scholarships is to start by researching different scholarship programs. You can search online or ask your school or college for information on available scholarships. Once you have identified a few scholarships that you are interested in, you should read the application instructions carefully and make sure that you meet all the eligibility criteria. You should also gather any documents that are required for the application and create a list of any questions or concerns that you have about the application process. Finally, you should submit your application materials as soon as possible to increase your chances of being selected for the scholarship.
