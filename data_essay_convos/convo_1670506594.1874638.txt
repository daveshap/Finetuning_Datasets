STUDENT: I'm thinking of using books and online articles.
COACH: That’s a great start! When researching your topic, make sure to look for reliable sources such as books from reputable publishers, journals, and online articles from credible websites. It’s also important to make sure that your sources are up-to-date and relevant to your topic. Once you’ve identified your sources, you can begin to take notes and organize your research. This will help you develop a clear thesis statement and structure your essay.
