STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admission essay is a great way for admissions officers to learn more about you. It helps them get a better understanding of who you are and what you can bring to their school. It's also a great opportunity for you to showcase your writing skills, creativity, and passion for the subject. By taking the time to craft a thoughtful essay, you can make a lasting impression on the admissions committee.
