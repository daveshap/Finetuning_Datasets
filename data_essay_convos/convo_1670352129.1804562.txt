COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm writing an essay about Buddhism.
COACH: That's great! What do you want to focus on in your essay? 
STUDENT: I'm interested in exploring how Buddhist principles can be applied to politics, particularly in the context of my undergrad experience in Germany.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic! Can you tell me a bit more about your experience in Germany and why it relates to Buddhism?
STUDENT: Sure. I lived in Germany for two years and studied at an international university. I was exposed to a variety of cultures and ways of thinking, which has really shaped my view of the world. I think Buddhism has a lot to offer in terms of understanding different perspectives and finding common ground.
COACH: Absolutely. How do you think Buddhism can be applied to politics specifically?
STUDENT: Well, I think it can help us see beyond our own biases and preconceived notions, and look at issues from a more holistic perspective. It can also help us find creative solutions to complex problems and foster greater understanding among different groups.
COACH: That's a great point! Can you give me an example of how this could be applied in practice?
STUDENT: Sure. For example, in Germany there are often debates between different political parties on how to solve certain issues. By looking at the issue through a Buddhist lens, we can see that both sides have valid points and try to create a solution that works for everyone. This can help us move beyond partisan politics and create more effective solutions.
