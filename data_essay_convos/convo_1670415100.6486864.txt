COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm struggling to write an essay about overcoming obstacles.
COACH: What kind of obstacles have you faced?
STUDENT: I'm from China and I'm a member of the LGBT community. I've faced a lot of rejection because of my identity.
COACH: That's a difficult situation. How have you been able to cope with the rejection?
STUDENT: I've tried to stay positive and focus on what I can do to make the best of the situation. I'm also trying to learn more about Islam, which has helped me to understand the importance of acceptance and tolerance.
COACH: That's great that you're taking proactive steps to overcome your obstacles. What do you hope to achieve by writing this essay?
STUDENT: I want to show future employers that I'm resilient and can handle difficult situations. I'm also hoping to find a job after college that will accept me for who I am.
COACH: That's a great goal. In your essay, you should focus on how you've worked hard to overcome the obstacles you've faced and the ways in which you've grown as a result. You should also include examples of how you've applied this knowledge in your life and how it has helped you to become a better person. This will help to show employers that you have the strength and determination to succeed.
