COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a high school senior and I'm trying to figure out how to finance college. I'm also trying to get into a good college and I'm wondering what admissions officers are looking for.
COACH: That's a great question! Financing college can be complicated, but there are a few options that you should consider. You can apply for federal aid like grants and loans, or you can look for scholarships. You can also look into private student loans if those other options don't work for you. As for what admissions officers are looking for, it really depends on the college. Generally, they want to see a strong academic record, extracurricular activities, and a well-written essay. They also value diversity, so if you have any unique experiences or perspectives, it could help your application.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'm also interested in LGBT rights and I'm wondering if I should include that in my essay.
COACH: Absolutely! Your essay is a great opportunity to show the admissions officers who you are and what you care about. If LGBT rights are an important issue to you, then you should definitely include it in your essay. Just make sure that it's relevant to the topic and that you don't just mention it as a passing thought.
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. I'm also worried about finding a job after college, is there anything I can do now to prepare?
COACH: Absolutely! Start by doing some research into the field or industry you're interested in. Look into internships or volunteer opportunities that could help you gain experience in the field. You can also start networking with people who have experience in the field you're interested in. Finally, make sure you're taking the right classes in college to prepare you for a career after graduation. For example, if you're interested in attending UNC, make sure you take the appropriate classes to make sure you're ready for the job market after college.
