COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question! Generally, your essay should be finished when you feel like you have adequately answered the prompt and made a strong argument to support your application. Make sure to read over your essay multiple times to ensure that it is well-written, organized, and free of errors. Additionally, ask someone else to read your essay and provide feedback - this can help you identify any issues or areas for improvement.
