COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: I'm writing an essay about sexism in the Vietnam War.
COACH: That's an interesting topic. Can you tell me more about it? What angle are you taking with your essay?
STUDENT: I'm focusing on how the war changed the way women were treated in Europe and Asia. I want to compare the experiences of Jewish women in Europe before and during the war.
COACH: That's a great angle to take. What kind of research have you done so far?
STUDENT: I've read some books and articles about the war, and I've spoken to some veterans who served in Vietnam.
COACH: That's fantastic. What do you think admissions officers will be looking for in your essay?
STUDENT: I think they'll be looking for an insightful analysis of the different ways sexism affected women during the war. They'll also be looking for evidence to support my claims.
COACH: That makes sense. Have you started writing yet?
STUDENT: Not yet. I'm still gathering information and doing research.
COACH: That's great. Make sure you give yourself enough time to write a quality essay. Take your time and don't rush it. You want to make sure you're presenting your argument in the best way possible.
