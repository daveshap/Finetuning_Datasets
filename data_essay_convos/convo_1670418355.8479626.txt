COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay about my experiences with Islam, Yale, Buddhism, travel, and sexism.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic! Can you tell me a bit more about it? What specifically do you want to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to explore how my experiences with these different elements have shaped my worldview. I'm particularly interested in how Islam, Buddhism, and travel have influenced my understanding of gender roles and sexism.
COACH: That's a great angle to take with this essay. What experiences do you have with each of those topics that you'd like to include?
STUDENT: With Islam, I've been exposed to different interpretations of the religion through my family and friends. I've also had the opportunity to travel to Islamic countries and observe how gender roles are played out in different cultures. For Buddhism, I've studied the teachings and practices of the religion and taken part in meditation retreats. And with travel, I've been able to visit a variety of places around the world and observe how different societies view gender roles and sexism.
COACH: That's a great range of experiences that you can draw from. How have these experiences impacted your understanding of gender roles and sexism?
STUDENT: Through my experiences with Islam, I've come to understand that gender roles vary greatly depending on the culture and context. In some Islamic countries, women are expected to be submissive and follow certain dress codes, while in others they are given more freedom and autonomy. Buddhism has taught me that gender roles are not necessarily fixed and can be fluid depending on different situations. And traveling has shown me that sexism is still a major issue in many places around the world, but it is often addressed differently depending on the culture.
