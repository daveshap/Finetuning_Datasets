COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm hoping to write an essay about my experience with charity work in Europe, and how it has helped me understand racism and its effects.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic for an essay. What made you decide to focus on this particular experience?
STUDENT: Well, I was volunteering in a refugee camp in Europe and it was eye-opening to see the struggles of people from different backgrounds. I wanted to explore the issues of racism and how it affects people on a personal level.
COACH: That's very admirable. How long have you been volunteering in Europe?
STUDENT: I've been volunteering for about a year now.
COACH: Great. What kind of charity work have you been doing?
STUDENT: I've been helping out with food distribution, providing medical care, and mentoring some of the children.
COACH: That sounds like a lot of hard work. Do you think your experience in Europe has given you a better understanding of racism?
STUDENT: Definitely. Seeing the effects of racism firsthand has been really eye-opening and has made me more aware of the injustices that people of color face.
COACH: That's really powerful. Have you thought about how you want to structure the essay?
STUDENT: I'm thinking of starting with a brief overview of my experience in Europe and then focusing on the specific instances where I saw racism in action. From there, I'd like to discuss what I learned and how it has shaped my views on racism.
COACH: That sounds like a great way to approach the essay. Are you applying to any specific schools?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm applying to Harvard.
COACH: Great! Writing an essay for Harvard is a big challenge, but I'm sure you can do it. What kind of advice do you need to get started?
STUDENT: I'm not sure where to begin. I want to make sure my essay stands out and conveys my story in a meaningful way.
COACH: That's a great question. First, I recommend that you start by brainstorming your ideas and writing down any key points you want to make. Once you have an outline, you can begin to flesh out your essay and make sure your story is told clearly and concisely. You'll also want to make sure you use vivid language and strong evidence to back up your points. Good luck!
