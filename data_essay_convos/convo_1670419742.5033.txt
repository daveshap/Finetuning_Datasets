COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Princeton and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to write about.
COACH: That's understandable. Can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What kind of topics are you interested in?
STUDENT: Well, I'm really passionate about LGBT rights and helping refugees.
COACH: Great! Those are both really important topics. Have you ever written about either of those topics before?
STUDENT: No, I haven't.
COACH: That's okay. We can start by brainstorming some ideas. Let's start with LGBT rights. What kind of questions or issues would you like to explore?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I guess I'm interested in understanding how different countries are responding to the LGBT rights movement and what kind of progress is being made.
COACH: That's a great topic to explore. You could look at specific countries and their laws, policies, and public opinion on LGBT rights. You could also look at international organizations and their efforts to promote LGBT rights worldwide.
STUDENT: That sounds like a good idea. I'm also interested in understanding the challenges faced by refugees.
COACH: Absolutely. You could look at the causes of displacement, the impact of refugee crises on different countries, and the challenges faced by refugees when they arrive in their new homes. You could also look at the efforts of organizations and governments to help refugees.
STUDENT: That sounds interesting. I'm also wondering how I can get scholarships and grants for college.
COACH: Sure. There are lots of resources available online to help you find scholarships and grants. You can also use your essay to make a strong case for why you deserve financial aid. You can talk about your academic achievements, your community service, and any other unique experiences that make you stand out.
