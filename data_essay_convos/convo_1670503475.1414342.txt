COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question! Writing an argumentative essay requires you to make an argument about a certain topic. So, when it comes to writing about finding a job after college, you'll want to think about what kind of argument you want to make. Do you want to argue that it's easy to find a job after college, or do you want to argue that it's difficult?
Once you've chosen your argument, you'll need to research to find evidence to support it. Find statistics, case studies, and other sources that can back up your argument. Then, use this evidence to build your essay.
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: A good argumentative essay should include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. In the introduction, you'll want to provide some background information on the topic and then introduce your argument. In the body paragraphs, you'll present your evidence and explain why it supports your argument. Finally, in the conclusion, you'll summarize your argument and explain why it matters.
