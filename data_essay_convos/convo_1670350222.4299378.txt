COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi there, I'm applying to grad school and I'm having trouble writing my essay. I want to talk about my experiences with rejection and overcoming obstacles.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! Can you tell me more about what you've experienced?
STUDENT: Sure. I'm neurodiverse and I've faced a lot of challenges in my life. I've been rejected from jobs and educational opportunities because of it. I also identify as part of the LGBT community, so I've had to face discrimination and exclusion in some areas of my life.
COACH: Wow, that's really tough. What have you done to overcome these challenges?
STUDENT: Well, I've tried to stay positive and keep pushing forward. I've also done a lot of volunteer work to help other people who are facing similar struggles. I'm hoping that this will help show grad schools that I'm dedicated and resilient.
COACH: That sounds like a great way to demonstrate your dedication and resilience. Do you have any specific examples of how you've helped others?
STUDENT: Yes, I've done a lot of work with local charities and organizations. I've volunteered at homeless shelters, food banks, and other places where people need help. I've also done a lot of mentoring and tutoring for kids who are struggling in school due to their neurodiversity.
COACH: That's amazing! It sounds like you have a lot of experience helping others. How do you think that experience has helped you grow as a person and shaped your goals for the future?
STUDENT: It's definitely helped me appreciate the struggles that others face and understand the importance of helping others. It's also made me realize that I can make a difference in the world and that I can use my unique skills and experiences to help those in need. I want to continue to use my knowledge and abilities to make a positive impact in the world.
