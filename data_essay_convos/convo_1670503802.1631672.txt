COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should provide a sense of closure and resolution to your essay. It should also provide a summary of the main points you have made in your essay. You should also make sure to leave the reader with something to think about. A good conclusion can make the difference between an average essay and a great one.
