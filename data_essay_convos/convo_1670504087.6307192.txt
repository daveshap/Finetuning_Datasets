COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question! You'll know your essay is finished when you feel confident that it accurately reflects the message you want to convey. It should be organized, well-crafted, and free of errors. The best way to ensure that your essay is finished is to have someone else read it and give you feedback. That way you can make any necessary revisions before submitting it.
