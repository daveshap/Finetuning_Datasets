COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write my college application essay and I was wondering what admissions officers look for in an essay?
COACH: Great question! Admissions officers are looking for essays that demonstrate a student's unique perspective, life experiences, and passions. They want to get to know who you are as a person, so it's important to be honest and genuine in your writing. If you have any particular areas of interest or experiences that you'd like to highlight, those can be great topics to focus on. For example, if you're a refugee, you could write about the challenges you faced when leaving your home country and how that experience has shaped who you are today. Or if you've traveled a lot, you could discuss how that has impacted your worldview and how it has made you a more open-minded and tolerant person. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful, thank you! I was thinking of writing about my travels and how they've shaped my view of the world, but I'm not sure how to make it stand out.
COACH: Absolutely! When writing about your travels, it's important to focus on the details and how they have shaped your perspective. You could start by talking about a particular place that you visited and the impact it had on you. Talk about the sights, smells, and sounds that you experienced and how they left an imprint on you. Then, you could discuss how this experience changed the way you think about the world, and how it has influenced your goals and ambitions for the future. 
STUDENT: That sounds great, I think I can use that. I'm applying to Harvard and NCSU, do you think it will work for both?
COACH: Absolutely! Your essay should be tailored to each school you're applying to, but the core message should remain the same. Focus on your unique experiences and how they have shaped you as a person. Harvard and NCSU both want to know who you are and what drives you, so make sure to express that in your essay. Good luck!
