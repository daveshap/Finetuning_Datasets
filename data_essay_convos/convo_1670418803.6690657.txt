COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm applying to a college in Germany. I'm writing an admissions essay about my experience as a Muslim in America and how it has shaped my identity. I'm not sure how to make my essay stand out from the rest.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic and I'm sure you can craft an amazing essay from it. Let's start by talking about your experience as a Muslim in America. What has been your journey like?
STUDENT: Well, growing up as a Muslim in America was challenging. I faced a lot of discrimination and prejudice from my peers and the wider community. It was difficult to find people who understood or respected my beliefs and values.
COACH: That must have been tough. Can you tell me more about how you overcame these challenges and how they shaped your identity?
STUDENT: Sure. Despite all the difficulties I faced, I was determined to stay true to my faith and values. I found strength and resilience in my religion and it helped me stay grounded and focused on my goals. My faith also taught me the importance of compassion and understanding for others, which I think is an essential part of life.
COACH: That's really inspiring. Now, let's talk about the college application process. How does college admission work in Germany?
STUDENT: Well, the admission process in Germany is quite different from what we have in the US. The main difference is that the admission process is much more selective and competitive. You need to have a very strong academic record and submit a personal statement that outlines why you would be a good fit for the college.
COACH: I see. So, now let's talk about your essay. What are some of the key points that you would like to emphasize in your essay?
STUDENT: I'd like to emphasize my determination and resilience in the face of adversity. I want to show that despite all the challenges I faced, I was able to stay true to my faith and values and use them to build a strong sense of identity. I also want to demonstrate my commitment to learning and growing as an individual. Finally, I want to show that I'm a good fit for the college by highlighting my academic achievements and my passion for learning.
