COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi there! I'm an undergrad student and I'm struggling to write my essay. I feel like I'm a boring person and don't have anything interesting to say.
COACH: That's a common feeling, but I'm sure you have something interesting to say in your essay. Can you tell me more about why you're writing it?
STUDENT: I'm writing it for my college application. I want to get into a good school, but I'm not sure why college matters or what I can bring to the table that would be interesting.
COACH: College matters because it allows you to explore different areas of interest, develop skills, and build relationships. It also gives you the opportunity to learn more about yourself and find out what you're passionate about. You can bring your unique perspective to the table. Everyone has something special to offer, and neurodiversity is becoming increasingly important in college. What makes you unique?
STUDENT: Well, I think the fact that I'm neurodiverse sets me apart from other applicants. I'm a visual learner and I'm very creative. I also have a lot of experience working with children and I'm passionate about making a difference in their lives.
COACH: That's great! Those are all valuable qualities that you can use to your advantage in your essay. You can talk about how your neurodiversity has helped you to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions. You can also talk about the impact you've had on the lives of the children you've worked with. I'm sure you have a lot to offer that would make you stand out from other applicants.
