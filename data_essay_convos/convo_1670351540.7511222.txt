COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about my faith in Christianity, and I'm having trouble getting started.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting topic! What do you want to focus on specifically?
STUDENT: Well, I want to talk about how my faith has influenced my life, both personally and professionally.
COACH: That's great! What kind of evidence do you have to support your essay?
STUDENT: I have some personal anecdotes from my childhood that I think would be relevant, and I also have some academic research that I've done on the subject.
COACH: That's good. How do you plan on structuring your essay?
STUDENT: I was thinking of starting with a hook to draw the reader in, then going into the body of the essay where I discuss how my faith has shaped me, and then ending with a conclusion that ties it all together.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. Do you need any help with the parts of the essay, such as the hook or the conclusion?
STUDENT: Yes, I could use some help with the hook and the conclusion.
COACH: Sure, let's start with the hook. What kind of story can you tell that will draw the reader in and make them interested in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I could tell the story of my first trip to France, when I was 14. I went there with my church group and it was a really eye-opening experience for me. I saw how different cultures practice their faith, and it really changed my perspective on Christianity.
COACH: That's a great story! It will definitely grab the reader's attention. Now, for the conclusion, what kind of message do you want to leave the reader with?
STUDENT: I want to leave the reader with a sense of hope and optimism. I want to show them that faith can be a powerful tool for making positive changes in our lives.
COACH: Perfect. That's a great message to end on. Is there anything else I can help you with?
STUDENT: Actually, yes. I'm also looking for scholarships and grants that I can apply for, so I can travel more and learn more about Christianity in other countries.
COACH: That's a great idea. Let me do some research and I'll get back to you with some options. In the meantime, keep working on your essay and don't forget to take advantage of the resources I've provided!
