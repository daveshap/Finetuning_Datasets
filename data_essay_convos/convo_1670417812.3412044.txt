STUDENT: It's made me more open-minded and aware of different cultures and beliefs. It's also given me a greater appreciation for beauty and art in general. It's also encouraged me to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.
COACH: That's great! So what kind of experiences have you had that have helped you develop these skills?
STUDENT: I've been fortunate enough to travel a lot, which has given me the opportunity to experience different cultures and artforms.
