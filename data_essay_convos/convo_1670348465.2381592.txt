COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi there! I'm looking for some guidance on how to write an essay about my passions and my neurodiversity.
COACH: That sounds like a great essay topic! Do you have any particular focus in mind? Are you looking to explore your passions within the context of Judaism, Buddhism, or something else?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm looking to explore my passions within the context of Judaism. I'm interested in learning more about my identity as a Jew and how it has shaped my views and perspectives on the world.
COACH: That's a great topic! It sounds like you already have a lot of ideas to work with. What kind of structure are you thinking of for your essay?
STUDENT: I'm not sure yet. I was thinking of starting with a personal narrative of my journey as a Jew and then exploring my passions and how they relate to my identity.
COACH: That's a great idea. You could start by introducing your story, then move into exploring your passions, and then wrap up with how your passions have shaped your identity as a Jew. What kind of research have you done so far?
STUDENT: I've read some books about Jewish history and culture, but I haven't done much research yet into my passions and how they relate to my identity.
COACH: That's a great place to start. It sounds like you have a good foundation of knowledge to build on. Have you thought about how you want to present your research in your essay?
STUDENT: Not really. I was thinking of presenting it in a narrative format, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.
COACH: Narrative can be a great way to tell your story, but there are other approaches that might work better depending on what kind of information you're trying to convey. Have you considered using a more analytical approach, such as exploring the connections between your passions and your identity?
STUDENT: Yes, I think that could work. I'm not sure how to go about it though.
COACH: Analytical essays can be tricky, but there are a few steps you can take to make it easier. First, you'll want to identify the key points you want to make in your essay. Then, you can use research to support those points and draw connections between them. Finally, you can use your own experiences to illustrate how those points are relevant to your identity as a Jew. Does that sound like something you can work with?
STUDENT: Yes, that sounds great. I think I have a better idea of how to approach this essay now. Is there anything else I should consider?
COACH: One thing to keep in mind is that writing about your passions and identity can be very personal, so make sure to take the time to reflect on your experiences and emotions. It can also be helpful to look into scholarships and grants related to your topic. Good luck!
