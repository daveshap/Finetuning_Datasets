COACH: That's a great question! I'm not an expert on grants, but I can help you with your admissions essay. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for guidance on? 
STUDENT: I'm applying to college and need help writing my admissions essay.
COACH: Perfect! What specifically do you need help with? Are you having trouble getting started or do you need help refining your ideas?
