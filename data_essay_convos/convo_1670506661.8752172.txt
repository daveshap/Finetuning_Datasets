COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: first generation college student?
COACH: Yes, I can help you with that. What kind of essay are you writing? Is it for an admissions essay or something else?

COACH: Alright, so you want to write a personal statement about being a first generation college student. First, let's start by talking about what that means to you. How has being a first generation college student affected your life and your goals?
STUDENT: Being a first generation college student has been both a blessing and a challenge. On the one hand, it has given me the opportunity to go to college and pursue my dreams. On the other hand, it has been difficult because I lack the guidance and support that my peers have from their parents who have gone through the college experience before.
COACH: That's great. It sounds like you have a good understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with being a first generation college student. Now, what do you think are the most important things you want to communicate in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to communicate that I am determined to succeed despite the challenges I face as a first generation college student. I also want to show that I am resilient and resourceful, and that I can use my experiences and knowledge to make a positive impact. Lastly, I want to demonstrate how I can use my unique perspective to contribute to the college community.
COACH: Those are all great points. Now, let's talk about how to structure your essay. What do you think would be the best way to organize your thoughts and create a strong narrative?
STUDENT: I think I should start by introducing myself and my background. Then, I could talk about the challenges I faced as a first generation college student and how I overcame them. After that, I could discuss how I'm using my experiences to make a positive impact. Finally, I could explain how I plan to use my unique perspective to contribute to the college community.
COACH: That's a great plan. Now, let's talk about how to make your essay stand out. What kind of details can you include to make your essay more interesting and memorable?
STUDENT: I can include specific examples of how I've used my experiences and knowledge to make a positive impact. I can also include stories about how I overcame obstacles and how I plan to use my unique perspective to contribute to the college community. Additionally, I can talk about the people who have helped me along the way and how they have influenced my journey.
