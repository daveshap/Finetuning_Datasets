COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for advice on how to write an essay about my experiences in Europe.
COACH: Great! What kind of experiences do you want to talk about?
STUDENT: Well, I recently went on a two-month trip to Europe and I had some really amazing experiences. I want to talk about the different places I visited, the people I met, and the things I learned.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic. What do you think makes your experience stand out?
STUDENT: I think it's the fact that I did a lot of travelling alone and was able to experience so much on my own.
COACH: That's a great angle to take with your essay. How do you plan to structure your essay?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I know I want to start by talking about my motivations for going on the trip, then I want to move on to the different places I visited, and then wrap up with some reflections on my experience.
COACH: That's a great structure. You could also consider adding in some personal anecdotes about your travels, as well as some reflections on how your experiences have shaped you as a person. That will make your essay more interesting and personal.
STUDENT: That's a great idea. I hadn't thought of that.
COACH: It's always a good idea to add in personal stories and reflections. It helps to give the reader a better sense of who you are and what your experiences meant to you.
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. How can I make sure my essay is compelling and interesting?
COACH: You want to make sure that your essay is well-structured and that you use vivid language to bring your experiences to life. Additionally, you want to make sure that you focus on the most important parts of your story and don't get too bogged down in details. Finally, make sure to include some reflection on what your experiences taught you and how they have changed you as a person. That will make your essay stand out from the crowd.
