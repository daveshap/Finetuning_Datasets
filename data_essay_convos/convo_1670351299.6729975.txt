COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to apply to grad school and I'm not sure what to write about in my personal statement.
COACH: That's a great question! It can be difficult to know where to start when writing a personal statement. What is your goal for the essay? Are you trying to explain why you are a good fit for the graduate program or are you trying to tell a story about your journey to this point?
STUDENT: I think I'm trying to do both. I want to explain why I'm a good fit, but I also want to tell my story and why I'm passionate about this field.
COACH: That sounds like a great approach. Your personal statement should be a combination of both. Start by thinking about what you want to say and why you want to say it. What experiences have shaped you and your interest in the field? How can you use those experiences to demonstrate why you would be a great fit for the program?
STUDENT: Well, I've been interested in this field since I was a child. I've always had a passion for the subject matter and I think I have the skills and knowledge to excel in the program.
COACH: Great! That's a great start. Now, think about how you can use specific examples to illustrate your points. What experiences have you had that demonstrate your passion and expertise in this field? How have those experiences prepared you for grad school?
STUDENT: Well, I've taken several classes in the subject matter and I've done some research in the area. I've also volunteered with organizations related to this field and I've been able to see firsthand the impact it has on people.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of experience that you can draw on for your essay. Now, think about how you can tie all of these experiences together to make a compelling argument for why you would be a great addition to the program. What are some of the skills and knowledge you have acquired through these experiences that make you a great fit?
STUDENT: Through my classes and research, I've developed a strong understanding of the theories and concepts related to the field. I've also gained experience working with people in the field, which has given me a better understanding of how to apply the theories and concepts in real-world settings.
COACH: Perfect! These are all great points to make in your essay. Now, think about how you can draw on these experiences to tell a story. What is the narrative you want to tell? What is the main point you want to make?
STUDENT: I want to tell a story about my journey to this point and how my experiences have shaped my passion for this field. I want to demonstrate why I'm a great fit for the program and how I can contribute to the success of the program.
COACH: That's an excellent story to tell. Now, think about how you can structure your essay to make it clear and concise. What are the main points you want to make? How can you organize them in a way that makes sense?
STUDENT: I think I can start with a brief introduction about my background and how I became interested in this field. Then, I can discuss my experiences and how they have shaped my knowledge and skills. Finally, I can explain why I'm a great fit for the program and what I can contribute.
COACH: That's a great plan! Now, think about how you can make your essay stand out. What unique perspective can you bring to the essay? What makes you different from other applicants?
STUDENT: I think I can talk about how my experiences have shaped my understanding of the field and how I can use that knowledge to make an impact. I also want to emphasize my commitment to the program and how I plan to use my knowledge and skills to help the program succeed.
