COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to undergrad and med school and I need help writing my admission essays.
COACH: Okay, great. So what topics do you want to write about? 
STUDENT: Well, I'm a Christian and I want to talk about my faith in my essays. 
COACH: That's a great topic to explore. Could you tell me more about how you want to discuss Christianity in your essay?
STUDENT: Sure. I want to talk about how my faith has shaped my values, beliefs, and outlook on life. I want to show the admissions committee that my faith is an integral part of who I am and how it has influenced my decisions. 
COACH: That sounds like a great angle for your essay. What specific examples or stories can you think of that demonstrate how Christianity has impacted your life?
STUDENT: Well, one example is when I was in high school and had to make a tough decision about which college to attend. My faith guided me to make the right choice, even when it wasn't the most popular one. I also want to talk about how my faith has shaped my view of the world and how it has helped me to be more compassionate and understanding towards others. 
COACH: Those are great examples. Can you think of any other ways that Christianity has impacted your life?
STUDENT: Yes, definitely. I think it's really important to talk about how my faith has helped me to stay focused and motivated in difficult times. I also want to talk about how it's helped me to stay humble and grateful for all the blessings I've been given in life. 
COACH: Those are excellent points. It sounds like you have a lot of great material to work with. Let's start brainstorming some ideas for how to structure your essay and make it as compelling as possible.
