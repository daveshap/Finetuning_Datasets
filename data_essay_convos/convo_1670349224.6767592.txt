COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi there! I'm looking for some help with my essay for grad school. I'm applying to engineering programs at Harvard and a law school in Thailand.
COACH: Great, it sounds like you have a challenging and ambitious goal. Can you tell me more about yourself and why you're interested in pursuing this path?
STUDENT: Sure! My name is John and I'm currently a junior in college studying engineering. I've always been passionate about technology and its potential to shape the future. I'm especially interested in the ways technology can be used to improve access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. That's why I want to pursue a graduate degree in engineering and eventually use my skills to make a difference in the world.
COACH: That's an admirable goal! It sounds like you have a clear vision of your future and how you'd like to contribute to society. What do you think sets you apart from other applicants?
STUDENT: Well, I think my experience with international travel has given me a unique perspective on the world. I've lived in Thailand for two years and traveled to many other countries. This has allowed me to gain an understanding of different cultures and how they interact. I believe this experience will help me to better understand the global implications of engineering and how it can be used to benefit all of humanity.
