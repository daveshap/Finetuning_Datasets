STUDENT: Well, I'm really interested in medicine and I want to go to medical school.

STUDENT: Yes, I recently volunteered at a hospital and it really opened my eyes to the importance of compassionate care.
COACH: Perfect! Now let's think of a way to structure your essay. What kind of story do you want to tell?
STUDENT: I want to talk about how my volunteering experience made me realize that I have a passion for helping people and that I want to pursue a career in medicine.
COACH: Great! So you could start by introducing your volunteering experience, then talk about what you learned from it, and end with how it inspired you to pursue a career in medicine. Does that sound like a plan?
