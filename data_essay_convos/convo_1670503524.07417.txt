COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: An engaging essay is one that has a clear structure and provides the reader with a strong introduction, an interesting main body, and a powerful conclusion. It should also have a unique perspective and be written in a way that captures the reader's attention. Additionally, it should be well-crafted and free of errors.
