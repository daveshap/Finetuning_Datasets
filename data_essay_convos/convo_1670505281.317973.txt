COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do grants work?
COACH: Grants are a form of financial aid that students can apply for to help pay for college. Generally, grants are need-based and do not require repayment. Grants are typically awarded by the federal government or state governments, but may also be offered by private organizations or businesses. To apply for a grant, you will need to fill out an application and provide any required documentation. The amount of money you receive will depend on the type of grant and your financial situation.
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: When writing a college admissions essay, you want to focus on why you are the ideal candidate for the program you are applying to. Consider what makes you unique and how your experiences have shaped who you are today. You should also include any relevant academic accomplishments, such as awards or honors, and any extracurricular activities you have participated in. Additionally, discuss your goals for the future and how attending the college you are applying to can help you achieve those goals. Finally, make sure to proofread your essay and have someone else review it to ensure it is error-free and conveys your message clearly.
