COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm having trouble writing my college essay. I want to write about my experience growing up in a poor family and how it has shaped my views on social issues like sexism and inequality.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic. Could you tell me a bit more about your background and what led you to choose this topic?
STUDENT: Sure. I grew up in a low-income household and saw firsthand how sexism and inequality can affect people's lives. I've been involved in charity work since I was a kid and I've seen how it can make a difference in people's lives. I want to use my essay to talk about how my upbringing has shaped my views on social issues and why I believe it's important to work towards creating a more equitable society.
COACH: That's a great topic for your essay. It sounds like you have a lot of personal experience to draw from. What kind of challenges have you faced because of your background and how have you overcome them?
STUDENT: Well, growing up in a low-income household was difficult. I had to work hard to get good grades and take extra classes in order to be competitive for college admissions. I also had to fight against a lot of stereotypes and assumptions about people from low-income backgrounds. But I was determined to succeed and I worked hard to get into college.
COACH: That's really inspiring! It sounds like you have a lot of motivation and drive. What would you like to accomplish with your essay?
STUDENT: I want to use my essay to show the admissions committee at Yale that I'm a hardworking and determined individual who is passionate about social issues and wants to use my education to make a difference. I want to showcase my unique perspective on these issues and convince the committee that I would be a valuable addition to their community.
