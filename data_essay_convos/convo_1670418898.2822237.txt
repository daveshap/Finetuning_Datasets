COACH: Great, let's get started. Can you tell me a bit more about why you're applying to Harvard?
STUDENT: Well, I've always been fascinated by the culture and history of France, and I'm hoping to study French at Harvard.
COACH: That's an excellent goal! What makes you passionate about French?

COACH: That's wonderful. So, why do you think an admission essay is important for your application?
STUDENT: I think the essay is important because it gives the admissions committee an insight into who I am as a person. It allows me to show them my personality, my interests, and my goals. It also allows me to demonstrate my writing skills and my ability to articulate my thoughts.
COACH: That makes a lot of sense. What kind of topics have you been considering for your essay?
STUDENT: I've been thinking about discussing my volunteer work, my experience studying abroad in France, and my personal statement about why I want to study at Harvard.
COACH: Those are all great topics! Do you have any questions about how to structure your essay or how to make it stand out from other applicants?
