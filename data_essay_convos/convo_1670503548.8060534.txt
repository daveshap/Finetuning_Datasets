COACH: An engaging essay is one that captures the reader's attention and keeps them interested. You can do this by writing in an interesting and unique way, using vivid language, and presenting a compelling argument. It's also important to make sure your essay is organized and structured in a way that makes sense to the reader. Finally, don't forget to proofread your essay for any errors.
