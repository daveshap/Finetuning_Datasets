COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm having trouble figuring out how to write my essay. I'm applying for college and I'm from a single parent home, and I want to talk about the challenges I've faced and how they've shaped me.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting topic! Could you tell me a bit more about it? What kind of challenges have you faced?
STUDENT: Sure. Well, I'm part of the LGBT community, so I've had to deal with a lot of discrimination and erasure in my life. I'm also Buddhist, so that has been a challenge in terms of understanding my faith and how it works with the rest of the world. And then there's the financial aspect of college - I'm not sure how that works, or how to make it work for me.
COACH: That's a lot of unique issues to tackle in one essay. Let's start with the financial aspect first. How does financing college work?
STUDENT: Well, I know that I can apply for grants and scholarships, but I'm not sure which ones are available to me or how to go about finding them.
COACH: That's a great question! There are lots of resources available to help you find grants and scholarships. You can start by researching online and talking to your guidance counselor or financial aid office at your school. Additionally, if you're a member of the LGBT community, there may be specific scholarships available to you.
Once you've found some potential options, you'll need to fill out applications and submit any required documents. Make sure to read all the instructions carefully and follow all the deadlines.
STUDENT: Okay, that's really helpful. Now, what about the other parts of my essay? How do I go about writing the hook, the middle, and the conclusion?
COACH: A good hook is important to draw in the reader and set the tone for the essay. You want to make sure it's engaging and relevant to your topic. For the middle, focus on developing your ideas and giving examples to illustrate them. Finally, the conclusion should tie everything together and provide a sense of closure. Make sure to leave the reader with something to think about.
