COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: first generation college student?
COACH: Sure, let’s talk about that. What would you like to know?
STUDENT: Well, I’m not sure where to start with this essay. What do admissions officers look for when they read essays from first-generation college students?
COACH: Great question! Admissions officers look for essays that show a student’s passion, commitment, and potential. They want to see that the student is motivated and has a clear plan for their future. They also look for essays that demonstrate an understanding of the challenges that come with being a first-generation college student, and how the student has overcome them. Finally, they look for essays that show the student’s unique perspective and how it will contribute to the college community. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. What tips do you have for writing an effective admissions essay as a first-generation college student?
COACH: First, make sure to tell your story. You want to be able to show the admissions officers who you are and why you’re a great fit for the school. Talk about your background, your family, and how you got to where you are today. Show how you’ve grown and what you’ve learned from the challenges you’ve faced.
Second, focus on the positives. You don’t need to dwell on the difficulties you’ve experienced, but rather talk about how you’ve used those experiences to make yourself a stronger candidate.
Third, make sure to proofread your essay. This is especially important for first-generation college students, as admissions officers may be looking for any signs of a lack of preparation or dedication.
Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. A professional essay coach can help you craft an essay that will make you stand out from the crowd and give you the best chance at getting into your dream college.
