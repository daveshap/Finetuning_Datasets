COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm having trouble writing my essay. I don't feel like I'm interesting or have anything unique to say.
COACH: That's okay! Everyone has something unique to say, it's just a matter of figuring out what that is. Tell me a bit about yourself. What are your goals and objectives for college?
STUDENT: Well, I want to get a degree in business and eventually become a successful entrepreneur. I also want to make sure I'm getting the most out of my college experience.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish. Now, let's talk about your essay. What do you think makes you unique?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I think I'm a pretty boring person.
COACH: That's not true at all! Everyone has unique experiences and perspectives. Think about your life and what makes it unique. What have you experienced that others may not have? What values do you hold that are important to you? What about your background or upbringing?
STUDENT: Well, I'm the first in my family to go to college. I think that gives me a unique perspective on education and what it means to be successful.
COACH: That's great! You can use this experience to talk about how education has shaped your life and your goals. You can also talk about how you plan to use your degree to make a difference in the world. This is a great way to make your essay stand out and show the admissions committee why you're a good fit for UNC.
