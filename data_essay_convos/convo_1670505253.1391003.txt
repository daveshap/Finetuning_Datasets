STUDENT: how do grants work?
COACH: Grants are typically awarded to students who demonstrate financial need and meet certain criteria. They are generally offered by the federal government, state governments, colleges, universities, private organizations, and foundations. Depending on the type of grant, they may be used to pay for tuition, books, living expenses, and other educational costs. To apply for a grant, you'll need to fill out an application and provide information about your finances, academic background, and other relevant information.
