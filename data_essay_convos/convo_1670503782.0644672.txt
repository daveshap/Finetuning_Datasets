COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should be the strongest part of your essay. It should summarize your main points and leave the reader with a sense of closure. It should also provide a lasting impression on the reader. To make sure your conclusion is strong, make sure you revisit your thesis statement and provide a call to action. Additionally, use the conclusion to address any lingering questions or unresolved issues.
