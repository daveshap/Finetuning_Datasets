COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to med school and I need help with my essay.
COACH: Great! What kind of help do you need?
STUDENT: I'm not sure where to start. I know I need to talk about my skills and achievements, but I'm not sure how to do that without sounding boastful.
COACH: That's a great question! Let's start by talking about your skills and achievements. What are some of the things that you're proud of or that you think would be beneficial to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I've been involved in a lot of volunteer work, like helping out at a local food bank. I also have a strong academic record, and I'm a part of a neurodiversity group on campus.
COACH: Those are all great accomplishments! What I suggest is to focus on one or two of those experiences and use them to demonstrate how you have grown as a person. For example, if you talk about your volunteer work, you could discuss how it has helped you develop empathy or how it has given you a greater understanding of the needs of others.
For your academic record, you could talk about how it has shown your commitment to learning and how it has helped you develop skills such as problem-solving or research.
Now let's talk about the structure of your essay. What parts of the essay are you familiar with?
STUDENT: I know about the introduction, body, and conclusion.
COACH: Great! Now let's think about how to make your essay stand out. Have you ever been to France?
STUDENT: Yes, I spent a semester studying abroad there.
COACH: That's fantastic! You could use your experience in France to create a unique hook for your essay. You could start by talking about a memorable experience you had while you were there and then use that to transition into the main body of your essay. This will give your essay a personal touch and make it stand out from the rest.
Finally, let's talk about your conclusion. The conclusion is where you wrap up your essay and leave a lasting impression on the reader. You could use this section to reiterate the skills and achievements you discussed earlier and explain how they have prepared you for success in med school.
