COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm a senior in high school and I'm trying to figure out how to get scholarships and grants for college.
COACH: That's a great question! Can you tell me a bit more about your situation? What college are you applying to, and what kind of essay do you need to write?
STUDENT: I'm applying to North Carolina State University and I need to write an essay about my experiences as a member of the LGBT community.
COACH: Okay, so you want to write an essay about your experiences as an LGBT person. That's a great topic to explore! Can you tell me a bit more about what you want to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to focus on how my experiences have shaped me and how they have made me a better person. I also want to talk about my experience as an international student coming from China and how it has impacted my life.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting essay topic! When it comes to structure, have you thought about how you want to approach the essay? 
STUDENT: Not really. I'm not sure where to start or how to organize my thoughts.
COACH: That's totally understandable. One way to approach it is to start by brainstorming some ideas and then organizing them into an outline. That way, you can get a better sense of the overall structure of your essay. Once you have an outline, you can start filling in the details and expanding on your ideas. Does that sound like something you could try? 
STUDENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I think I can manage that.
COACH: Great! If you need any help with the brainstorming process or have any questions about the essay structure, feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to help you out.
