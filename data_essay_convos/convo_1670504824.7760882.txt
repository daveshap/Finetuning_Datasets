STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: One way to make your essay shorter is to focus on the main points you want to make, and then eliminate any unnecessary details or tangents. You can also use active verbs and concise language to make your writing more succinct. Additionally, you can look for ways to combine multiple ideas into one sentence if possible. Finally, make sure you are only including relevant information that is absolutely necessary for your essay.
