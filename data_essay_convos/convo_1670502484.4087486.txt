COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: It matters because it is your opportunity to tell the admissions committee who you are and why they should consider you for admission. It's your chance to stand out from the other applicants and make a positive impression. It also shows that you have done your research and have taken the time to craft an essay that reflects your personality, interests, and goals.
