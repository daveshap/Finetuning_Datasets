COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I have no idea what to write about.
COACH: That's ok, let's start by exploring a few topics that interest you. Is there any particular subject you are passionate about, such as charity work, Christianity, refugee issues, or something else?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm interested in charity work.
COACH: Great! What kind of charity work are you interested in?
STUDENT: I'm interested in helping refugees.
COACH: That's wonderful! Can you tell me more about why this interests you?
STUDENT: I think it's important to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves and I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to live a better life.
COACH: That's a great perspective! What kind of charity work do you think would be most effective for helping refugees?
STUDENT: I think providing basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing is essential. I also think providing access to education, job training, and health care can go a long way in helping refugees transition into their new lives.
COACH: Those are all great suggestions. What else do you think could be done to help refugees?
STUDENT: I think it's important to provide emotional and psychological support to refugees, especially those who have experienced trauma. I also think it's important to provide legal assistance to help them navigate the process of seeking asylum. 
COACH: Those are excellent ideas. Now, let's talk about how you can turn these ideas into an essay. What kind of structure do you think would be best for this topic?
STUDENT: I think it would be best to start with a brief introduction of the issue and then move into discussing the different ways that charity work can help refugees. After that, I could discuss the importance of providing emotional and psychological support, as well as legal assistance. Finally, I could end with a conclusion that summarizes my points and calls for further action. 
COACH: That's a great outline for your essay! Is there anything else you need help with before you get started?
