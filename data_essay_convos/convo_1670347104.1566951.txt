COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a student from the Philippines and I'm applying to college in China. I want to know why does an admission essay matter and what do I write about in my college admission essay?
COACH: That's a great question! An admission essay is an important part of the college application process because it gives you a chance to express your unique story and show the admissions committee who you are beyond your grades and test scores. It's an opportunity to showcase your personality and writing skills as well as demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the college and its values.
When it comes to what to write about, it really depends on the prompt that you are given. The prompt should give you some guidance on what the admissions committee is looking for, so make sure to read it carefully. Generally speaking, you'll want to focus on your experiences, goals, and accomplishments that demonstrate why you would be an asset to the college. You can also use the essay to discuss any challenges that you have faced and how you overcame them, as well as any unique perspectives or insights that you have.
Finally, you should also make sure to explain why college matters to you, and why this particular college is the right fit for you. This is your chance to make a strong impression on the admissions committee and stand out from the other applicants, so make sure to take advantage of it!
