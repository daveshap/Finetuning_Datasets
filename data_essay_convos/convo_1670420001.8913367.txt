COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student and I'm trying to apply to Princeton. I'm from a poor family and I'm worried about how I'm going to find a job after college. I was wondering why my admission essay matters so much?
COACH: That's a great question! Your admission essay is important because it gives the admissions committee an insight into who you are as a person and how you think. It also helps them understand your motivations and goals. By writing a strong essay, you can demonstrate your ability to think critically and express yourself in a meaningful way. This can be especially important for a first-generation college student, as it helps show that you have the skills and determination to succeed. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. But I'm still worried about finding a job after college. What should I do to prepare for that?
COACH: Finding a job after college can be a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to make the process easier. First, you should start researching potential employers and jobs that interest you. Make sure to look for opportunities that are in line with your skills and interests. You should also reach out to people in your network and ask for advice. Finally, start putting together a portfolio of your work and accomplishments. This will help you stand out when applying for jobs.
