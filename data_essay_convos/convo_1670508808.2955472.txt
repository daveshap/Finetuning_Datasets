COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what if i get rejected?
COACH: That's a great question! Let's start by talking about what you're hoping to accomplish with this essay. What are your goals for the admissions essay?
STUDENT: I want to make sure that my application stands out and that I get accepted into the college I'm applying to.
COACH: That's a great goal! Let's talk about how to make that happen. First, let's think about what makes a good admissions essay. Generally speaking, admissions essays should be focused on telling your story in a unique and compelling way. What aspects of your life and experiences do you think would make your essay stand out?
STUDENT: Well, I have had some really interesting experiences that I think could make for a great essay. I've traveled to many countries, been involved in several extracurricular activities, and I've had some unique experiences in my family life.
COACH: That sounds like a great start! It's important to remember that admissions essays are very personal and should reflect your own unique story. So, when you're writing your essay, try to focus on what makes you unique and how that can be conveyed in your essay. Once you have an idea of what you want to write about, it's time to start planning out your essay. What kind of structure do you think would work best for your essay?
STUDENT: I think I want to start by introducing myself and then go into more detail about my experiences.
COACH: That's a great plan! You could start by introducing yourself and then move on to discussing your experiences in more detail. Make sure to include details about how these experiences have shaped who you are and why they make you a great fit for the college you're applying to. As you write, try to keep your essay focused and make sure that each sentence has a purpose. Once you've written your essay, it's important to spend time editing and revising it to make sure that it's the best it can possibly be. Good luck!
