COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: first generation college student?
COACH: Sure, tell me a bit more about your essay. What kind of research do you need to do?
STUDENT: I'm trying to write an essay about the challenges of being a first-generation college student.
COACH: That's an interesting topic. What kind of research do you need to do to support your essay?
STUDENT: I need to look into the experiences of other first-generation college students and research statistics on college success rates for first-generation students.
COACH: Okay, great. Let's start with the experiences of other first-generation college students. There are many resources available online that can provide you with information on this topic. You can also reach out to current and former first-generation college students and ask them about their experiences.
Next, let's look at the statistics. You can find data from various sources, such as government agencies or educational institutions. Try to find statistics that compare the college success rates of first-generation college students to those of non-first-generation college students. This will give you an idea of how first-generation college students fare in comparison to others.
Finally, you can also look into the programs and resources available to help first-generation college students succeed. This can provide valuable insight into the challenges that first-generation college students face and how they can be addressed.
I hope this helps you get started with your research. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
