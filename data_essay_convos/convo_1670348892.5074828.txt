COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a college student applying to Yale and I'm looking for help with my essay.
COACH: Great! What kind of essay are you working on?
STUDENT: It's an essay about my creativity and how it's been shaped by my Christian faith and my experiences in China.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic. Can you tell me more about how your faith and your experiences in China have shaped your creativity?
STUDENT: Sure. Growing up in a Christian family, I was taught that being creative was a way to express my faith. My parents encouraged me to explore my creativity through art, music, and writing. Then, when I went to China, I was exposed to a completely different culture, which opened my eyes to new ways of thinking and approaching life. This experience has made me more open-minded and has helped me to develop a unique perspective on creativity.
COACH: That's great. It sounds like you have a lot of interesting things to say about your creativity and how it's been influenced by your faith and your experiences in China. What do you think makes your essay stand out from other applicants?
STUDENT: I think what makes my essay stand out is that it shows how my faith and my experiences in China have helped me to develop a creative mindset. It also shows how I've been able to use my creativity to solve problems and come up with innovative solutions.
COACH: That's a great point. So, what would you like to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to focus on how my faith and my experiences in China have shaped my creativity and how I've been able to use my creativity to create something meaningful.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. What kind of structure do you think would work best for your essay?
STUDENT: I'm thinking of starting with an introduction that explains my faith and my experiences in China, then going into more detail about how those two things have shaped my creativity. I'd also like to include some examples of how I've used my creativity to create something meaningful.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. Have you started writing the essay yet?
STUDENT: I've written a few paragraphs, but I'm stuck on where to go next.
COACH: That's understandable. Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. What do you want the essay to accomplish?
STUDENT: I want the essay to show that I'm a creative person who can think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions. I also want to show that I'm driven to make a positive impact in the world.
COACH: That's a great goal. Based on what you've told me, I think it would be helpful to focus on specific examples of how you've used your creativity to make a difference in the world. That way, you can illustrate your point more clearly and give the admissions committee a better sense of who you are.
