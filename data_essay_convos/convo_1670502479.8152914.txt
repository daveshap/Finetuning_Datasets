COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admission essay is important because it helps the admissions committee get to know you better and understand why you are a good fit for their school. It also gives them an opportunity to evaluate your writing skills and assess how well you can express yourself. It can be a great way to stand out from other applicants and show off your unique personality.
