COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I get scholarships and grants?
COACH: Well, that's a great question. First off, I'd suggest doing some research to find out what scholarships and grants are available to you. You can also look into other financial aid options like student loans or work-study programs. Once you have a better idea of what's out there, you can start applying for the ones that fit your needs.
Now, let's talk about your essay. What type of essay is it?
STUDENT: It's a personal statement for law school.
COACH: Okay, great. So, the goal with a personal statement for law school is to show your passion for the field and demonstrate why you would make a great addition to the school. You'll want to focus on your experiences, goals, and why you're the best fit for the program. 
To get started, think about what makes you unique and how your experiences have shaped who you are today. You can also talk about your strengths and weaknesses, and how you plan to use them in law school. Finally, make sure to explain why you chose this particular law school and why you believe you would be a great addition to the student body. 
Once you have a good idea of what you want to include in your essay, you'll need to organize your thoughts into a structure. Start by writing an introduction that grabs the reader's attention and introduces your main points. Then, write a few body paragraphs that support your main points and explain why they're important. Finally, end with a conclusion that ties everything together and reiterates why you're the perfect candidate for the school. 
Good luck with your essay!
