COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm wondering how college admission works and what I need to do to get into a good school.
COACH: That's a great question! College admissions vary from school to school, but there are some general guidelines that you should follow. First, you should make sure that your grades are up to par. Most colleges look for students with a GPA of at least 3.0 or higher. You should also focus on your extracurricular activities, such as volunteer work or sports, to demonstrate your commitment to learning and community service. 
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. What else should I be doing?
COACH: You should also consider writing an essay that showcases your unique experiences and perspectives. This can be a great way to stand out from other applicants and demonstrate your commitment to the school's mission. Additionally, if you have any special talents or qualifications, such as fluency in a foreign language or experience in a particular field, you should highlight those as well. 
STUDENT: Okay, I think I understand. I'm planning on applying to law school and I want to talk about my experience in Vietnam. How should I go about this?
COACH: That's a great topic to explore in your essay! You should focus on how your experiences in Vietnam shaped your interest in law and how you plan to use your knowledge and skills to help others. Be sure to provide specific examples of how your time abroad has impacted your outlook and goals. 
STUDENT: Alright, I think I have a better idea of what I need to do. I'm also considering applying to Duke University. What should I know about their application process?
COACH: Duke University is a highly competitive school, so it's important to make sure that your application is as strong as possible. In addition to the standard requirements, Duke looks for students who are leaders and innovators. They want to see evidence of your leadership skills and your ability to think outside the box. You should also make sure to highlight any unique experiences or qualifications that you have that would make you a great fit for Duke.
