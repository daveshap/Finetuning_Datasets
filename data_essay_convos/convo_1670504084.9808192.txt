COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: A good way to tell if your essay is finished is to read it through several times and make sure that it answers the prompt, flows logically, and has no grammar or spelling errors. You can also ask someone else to read it and give you feedback. Finally, make sure that you have included all the elements of a good essay, such as an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
