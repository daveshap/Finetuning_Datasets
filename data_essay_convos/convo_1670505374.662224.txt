COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i apply for grants?
COACH: Applying for grants is a process that requires you to do some research. You need to find out which grants are available, what the requirements are for each grant, and how to apply for them. Once you have identified the grants you are interested in, you need to fill out the application forms and submit them. The application forms will ask you for information about your financial needs, educational goals, and other relevant information. After submitting the applications, you will need to wait for a response from the granting agency. 
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: When writing your essay for a grant application, you should focus on why you should receive the grant. You should explain your financial needs, how the grant money will help you reach your educational goals, and any other information that the granting agency may find relevant. Make sure to be clear, concise, and persuasive in your writing. You should also include any information that demonstrates your commitment to achieving your goals and any unique experiences or qualifications you have that set you apart from other applicants.
