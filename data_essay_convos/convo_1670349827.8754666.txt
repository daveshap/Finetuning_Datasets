COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay about my life and I'm having trouble figuring out what to include.
STUDENT: I grew up in a single-parent home, went to a public school, and don't really feel like I have anything interesting to say about myself.
COACH: That's okay! You don't need to feel like you have to have an extraordinary story to tell. Everyone has unique experiences and perspectives that can be valuable and interesting. Can you tell me more about your background? What are some of the challenges you have faced in your life?
STUDENT: Well, I guess one of the biggest challenges I've faced is figuring out how to finance college. I come from a low-income family, so I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for tuition.
COACH: That is a very common challenge for many students. Have you looked into scholarships, grants, or student loans? Those are all great options for financing college. Also, many universities offer financial aid packages as well, so be sure to look into that when you apply.
STUDENT: Ok, thanks. That's really helpful.
COACH: Of course! Is there anything else you wanted to ask about?
STUDENT: Yes, actually. How does the college admission process work?
COACH: The college admission process usually involves submitting an application, writing an essay, and submitting transcripts and test scores. Depending on the school, you may also need to submit letters of recommendation. It's important to make sure you understand the requirements for each school and submit all the necessary documents on time.
STUDENT: Thanks. I have one more question. How can I make my essay stand out?
COACH: That's a great question! One way to make your essay stand out is to focus on something unique about yourself. Maybe you have a special talent or interest in creativity and art. You could use that to showcase your personality and creativity in your essay. Another way to make your essay stand out is to focus on a particular experience or moment in your life that was meaningful to you. This can help to give your essay a personal touch.
