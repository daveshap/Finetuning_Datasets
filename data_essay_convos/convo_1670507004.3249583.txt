COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: That’s a great question. To make an essay engaging, you want to make sure you’re telling a story. Think about how you can use vivid details and anecdotes to draw the reader in and make them feel like they’re right there with you. You also want to make sure you’re connecting the essay to yourself and your experiences. This will help the reader understand why you’re pursuing this particular field and make them more invested in your essay.
STUDENT: What should I include in my personal statement for law school?
COACH: Your personal statement should be an opportunity to tell the admissions committee who you are as a person and what makes you unique. You should focus on your experiences that have shaped you and your perspective on the world. It’s also important to discuss your goals for the future and how law school will help you achieve those goals. Finally, make sure you’re highlighting any skills or qualities that make you stand out from other applicants.
