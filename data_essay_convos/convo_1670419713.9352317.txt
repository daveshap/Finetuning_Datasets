COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to write an essay about my experience studying Buddhism in Germany.
COACH: That sounds like a fascinating topic. Can you tell me more about it? What made you decide to study Buddhism in Germany?
STUDENT: Well, I was interested in exploring the differences between Buddhism in the East and in the West. I thought that by studying in Germany, I would be able to get a better understanding of how Buddhism is practiced in Europe.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of interesting material to work with. Do you have any specific questions about how to structure your essay or what makes an essay engaging?
STUDENT: Yes, I'm not sure how to organize my thoughts and make the essay engaging.
COACH: That's a great question. To make your essay engaging, it's important to focus on the details. You want to give the reader a sense of what it was like to study Buddhism in Germany. Try to include vivid descriptions of your experiences and observations. Also, think about how you can use your own personal story to illustrate the larger social issues at play. For example, if you experienced any cultural differences between the East and West, you could discuss those in your essay.
Finally, consider what makes the topic of Buddhism in Germany relevant to your readers. Why should they care about this topic? How does it relate to their own lives or experiences? These are all important questions that you can use to make your essay more engaging.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I think I have a better idea of how to structure my essay now. One more question though - I'm applying to UCLA and I'm wondering if there are any special requirements for the essay.
COACH: Yes, UCLA has specific requirements for their essays. They want to see that you can communicate clearly and effectively, so make sure that your essay is well-structured and easy to read. Additionally, they want to see that you can think critically and creatively, so make sure that your essay has a clear argument and is backed up with evidence. Finally, make sure that the essay is tailored to the particular school and program that you're applying to. Show them why you would be a great fit for UCLA!
