COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question! Let's start by talking about what you need to do to find a job after college. What have you done so far in your job search?
STUDENT: I've been researching different job opportunities and networking with people in my field.
COACH: That's great! Now, let's focus on crafting your thesis statement. What is the main point that you want to make in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to show that I'm well prepared for the job market and that I have the skills and experience necessary to be successful.
