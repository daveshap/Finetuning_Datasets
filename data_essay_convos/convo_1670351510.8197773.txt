COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about my experience growing up in a single parent home in Germany and how it shaped my views on politics and racism.
COACH: That's an interesting topic. Could you tell me more about your experience? What did you observe while growing up in Germany?
STUDENT: Well, I grew up in a small town in the south of Germany and I noticed that there was a lot of racism and prejudice against immigrants and people of color. I also noticed that many people were very conservative and didn't want to talk about politics or social issues.
COACH: That's a very powerful observation. Did this have an impact on your own views on politics and racism?
STUDENT: Definitely. Growing up in this environment made me realize how important it is to be open-minded and to stand up for what you believe in. It also made me realize the importance of understanding different perspectives and being willing to have difficult conversations about social issues.
COACH: That's a great insight. Can you tell me more about how this has impacted your views on politics and racism?
STUDENT: Sure. I think it's important to recognize the power dynamics at play in any political or social situation. I also think it's important to be aware of the history of racism and oppression, and to use that knowledge to inform our actions and decisions. I also believe that we need to be willing to challenge our own beliefs and assumptions in order to create a more just and equitable society.
COACH: That's a really thoughtful perspective. Can you tell me how this has impacted your views on politics and racism in other parts of the world, such as Thailand?
STUDENT: Absolutely. I think it's important to recognize that racism and oppression exist in all parts of the world, and that it's necessary to understand the history and context of each country in order to effectively address these issues. It's also important to recognize that the experiences of people in different countries can be vastly different, so it's important to be open to learning from each other and collaborating on solutions.
