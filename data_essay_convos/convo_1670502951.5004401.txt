COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what do admissions officers look for?
COACH: Admissions officers are looking for essays that demonstrate your ability to think critically and express yourself clearly. They want to see that you can effectively communicate your ideas, opinions, and experiences in a way that is engaging and meaningful. They also want to see that you have done your research and can articulate why you are the best fit for their college or university. 
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: The essay should include your main argument, or the point you are trying to make. You should also provide evidence to support your argument, such as facts, quotes, and examples. Be sure to explain why this evidence is relevant to your argument. Additionally, you should also include any counterarguments or opposing views, and explain why they are incorrect or why your argument is stronger. Finally, you should include a conclusion that summarizes your main points and restates your argument. 
STUDENT: How do I make my essay stand out?
COACH: One way to make your essay stand out is to use vivid language and strong imagery. This will help you create a more engaging and memorable piece of writing. Additionally, you should make sure to include personal stories or anecdotes that illustrate your argument in a unique and interesting way. Finally, you should make sure to proofread your essay for any errors or typos. This will show the admissions officers that you take your essay seriously and care about the quality of your work.
