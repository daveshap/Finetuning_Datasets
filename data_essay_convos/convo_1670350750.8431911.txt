COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm writing an essay on racism in Europe, particularly as it relates to Islam. I'm having trouble getting started and I'm not sure why an admission essay matters.
COACH: That's a great topic and one that could be very interesting to admissions officers. An admission essay is important because it gives you the opportunity to tell your story. It allows you to show the admissions committee who you are, what you care about, and why you should be admitted. So, what do you know about racism in Europe and how it affects Muslims?
STUDENT: Well, I know that there has been a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe in recent years. I also know that there have been a number of hate crimes against Muslims in some European countries.
COACH: Yes, unfortunately that is true. What else do you know about the issue?
STUDENT: I know that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in Europe, particularly in terms of employment and housing opportunities.
COACH: That's right. It's important to understand the context of the issue and how it affects people in Europe. What do you think are the causes of this discrimination?
STUDENT: I think it's mostly due to fear and misunderstanding. People don't always understand the beliefs and customs of Muslims, so they fear them and respond with prejudice.
COACH: That's a great observation. It's important to understand the root causes of racism and how it affects people in order to write a thoughtful essay. What have you done to research the issue?
STUDENT: I've done some online research and read some articles about the issue. I've also spoken to some people who have experienced discrimination first-hand.
COACH: That's great! It's important to get multiple perspectives when writing an essay. What do you think is the most important thing you can do to make your essay stand out?
STUDENT: I think it's important to be honest and personal in my essay. I want to make sure that I'm not just talking about facts and figures, but also sharing my own experiences and how I feel about the issue.
COACH: That's a great approach. Being honest and personal will help your essay stand out and make it more memorable to the admissions committee. Is there anything else I can help you with?
STUDENT: No, I think I'm good for now. Thank you for your help!
