COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: An engaging essay is one that captures the reader's attention from the very beginning. You want to make sure your introduction is interesting, and that it sets the tone for the rest of the essay. You also want to make sure your argument is well-supported with evidence, and that your conclusion ties everything together in a meaningful way.
