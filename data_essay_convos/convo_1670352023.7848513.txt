STUDENT: Well, I've always been fascinated by the history of Christianity and its impact on European politics. I've read a lot about it and I think it's really interesting.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic for your essay. What specifically about the history of Christianity and its impact on European politics do you find interesting?
