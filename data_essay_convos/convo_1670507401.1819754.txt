STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: A good opening for a personal statement for medical school should be engaging and capture the reader's attention. You want to introduce yourself, your interests, and why you are pursuing a career in medicine. Think about what makes you unique, and how you can express that in a few sentences. Also, make sure to keep it concise and to the point.
