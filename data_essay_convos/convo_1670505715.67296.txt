COACH: Rejection is always a possibility when you apply to college, but it doesn't mean that you can't succeed. It's important to remember that there are many factors that go into the admissions process, so don't let the fear of rejection keep you from trying. Instead, focus on writing a strong essay that showcases your unique story and experiences. That way, you can make sure that you are putting your best foot forward when applying.
