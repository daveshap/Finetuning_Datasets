COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question! Generally, your essay is finished when you have addressed all of the points that you need to make in order to make a strong argument for why you should be accepted into the college. You'll want to make sure that you have included enough details and evidence to support your claims, have a clear structure and flow, and have proofread your essay for any errors. Once you feel like you have accomplished all of these things, then your essay is finished!
