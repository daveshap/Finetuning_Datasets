COACH: Great! A term paper is a great way to demonstrate your research and writing skills. Let's start by breaking down the assignment. What is the topic of your paper?
STUDENT: I'm writing about the effects of climate change on ocean life.
COACH: That's an interesting topic. Have you done any research yet?
STUDENT: Yes, I've done some preliminary research and I have a few sources.
COACH: That's great! Before you start writing, it's important to have a clear thesis statement. This will be the main point of your paper and should include the main ideas you want to discuss. Can you think of a thesis statement for your paper?
