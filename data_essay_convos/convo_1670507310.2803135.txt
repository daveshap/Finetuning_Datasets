COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion is an important part of any essay, especially a personal statement for law school. It should summarize the major points you've made throughout the essay and leave the reader with a sense of closure. To start, think about what the main points of your essay are and how you can bring them together in a way that makes sense. You can also use the conclusion to emphasize why you are a great candidate for law school and how your experiences have prepared you for the future. Finally, make sure to use strong, concise language that ties everything together.
