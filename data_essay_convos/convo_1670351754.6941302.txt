COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Harvard and I'm having trouble understanding what admissions officers are looking for in an essay.
COACH: That's a great question. Harvard looks for essays that demonstrate a student's ability to think critically, to express themselves clearly, and to show passion and enthusiasm. They want to see that you can write well and that you have something meaningful to say. It's also important to make sure your essay is relevant to the prompt, so make sure to read it carefully and answer the question it asks.
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. But what about my personal statement? How can I make sure it stands out from the crowd?
COACH: Your personal statement should be a reflection of your unique experiences and perspectives. It should be a story that highlights your strengths, values, and goals. Make sure to include details that show rather than tell, and focus on how your experiences have shaped you as a person. It's also important to be honest and genuine in your writing.
STUDENT: Alright, that's helpful. What about grad school applications? Are there any specific tips or strategies I should keep in mind?
COACH: Yes, absolutely. When applying to grad school, you want to make sure to show that you have a clear plan for your future and how the program you're applying to will help you achieve those goals. You'll also need to demonstrate that you have the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful in the program. Finally, make sure to highlight any research experience or extracurricular activities that might make you stand out from the crowd.
STUDENT: Got it. One last thing - I'm writing an essay about racism and why it's still an issue today. Do you have any advice on how to approach this topic?
COACH: Absolutely. When writing about racism, it's important to focus on the facts and not get too emotional. Make sure to back up your points with evidence and provide examples of how racism has impacted people's lives. Additionally, it's important to be aware of your own biases and to strive for objectivity. Finally, make sure to include a call to action and explain why it's important to address racism today.
