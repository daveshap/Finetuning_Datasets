COACH: That's a great goal. Can you tell me more about why you want to study engineering in Europe?

COACH: That's admirable. What kind of experiences have you had that have made you interested in civil engineering?
STUDENT: Growing up, I was always fascinated with the different structures around me. I used to visit construction sites with my father and ask him questions about how things were built. That really sparked my interest in engineering.

STUDENT: I think my passion for engineering really sets me apart from other applicants. I'm motivated to learn and I'm willing to put in the hard work to reach my goals. I also have a unique perspective on engineering due to my diverse cultural background.
