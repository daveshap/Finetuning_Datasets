COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to college and I'm having a hard time figuring out how the admissions process works.
COACH: Sure, I can help you with that. First, let's talk about the parts of an essay. What have you heard about the hook, introduction, body, and conclusion?
STUDENT: Well, I know that the hook is supposed to be the first thing that grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to keep reading. I'm not sure what the introduction, body, and conclusion are supposed to include though.
COACH: That's great, you already have a good understanding of the hook! The introduction is where you introduce the main idea of your essay. It should provide some background information and set up the main argument. The body is the main part of your essay, which is where you develop your argument in more detail. You should include evidence and examples to support your argument. The conclusion is where you summarize your main points and explain why your argument is important. 
STUDENT: Got it. So, what else do I need to know about the college admissions process?
COACH: Well, there are a few other things to consider. For example, you should make sure to research the school you're applying to and understand their values and mission so that you can tailor your essay to fit the school. You should also make sure to proofread your essay and check for any errors. Finally, you should be aware of any potential biases or prejudices that may be present in the admissions process, such as sexism or racism. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful. One last question: what kind of job opportunities will I have after college?
COACH: That depends on your major and the type of career you want to pursue. Generally speaking, you'll have a variety of options. Some people go into business or finance, while others pursue careers in the arts or sciences. If you're looking for a career in medicine, you'll need to go to medical school and complete a residency program. You can also look into internships or volunteer opportunities to gain experience and make connections.
