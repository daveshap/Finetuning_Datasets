COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I am an undergrad student from the Philippines and I need help with my personal statement. I want to make it engaging but I'm not sure how to do that since I'm kind of a boring person.
COACH: That's understandable and don't worry, I'm sure we can make your essay stand out. First, let's start by understanding what makes an essay engaging. It's all about telling a story that is unique to you. Your essay should be focused on your own experiences, values, and perspectives. It should also focus on the positive aspects of your life, such as any accomplishments or challenges you've faced.
STUDENT: That makes sense. How do I make sure that my essay stands out?
COACH: To make your essay stand out, you'll want to use vivid language and imagery. Describe scenes and moments in detail, and use words that evoke emotion. Additionally, try to structure your essay in an interesting way. Instead of a linear narrative, you could use flashbacks, or even a metaphor or analogy to illustrate your point.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. What else can I do to make my essay engaging?
COACH: You can also use a few techniques to make your essay more engaging. For example, you can use dialogue to illustrate a scene or moment, or you can use humor to add levity to your essay. Additionally, you can use anecdotes to draw the reader in and make them feel connected to your story. Finally, make sure to proofread and edit your essay to ensure that it is free of errors and flows well.
