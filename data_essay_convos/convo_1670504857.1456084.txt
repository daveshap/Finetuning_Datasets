STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: A great way to make your essay shorter is to focus on one main idea. This will help you to create a clear thesis statement that will be the foundation of your essay. Additionally, you should look for areas where you can cut out unnecessary words and phrases, or combine sentences to make them more concise.
