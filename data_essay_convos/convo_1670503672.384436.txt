COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i get started writing?
COACH: Well, the best way to start your essay is to think about what you want to say. You should focus on a particular experience or story that demonstrates why you would be a great fit for the college and what you can contribute to the school. Once you have an idea of what you want to write about, you can start by brainstorming ideas and creating an outline.
STUDENT: What should I include in my essay?
COACH: Your essay should include an introduction, body, and conclusion. In your introduction, you should introduce yourself and explain why you are applying to the college. You should also mention the specific qualities that make you a good fit for the school. In the body of your essay, you should provide more detail about your story or experience, and explain how it has shaped who you are today. Finally, in your conclusion, you should summarize your points and explain why you are the best candidate for the college.
