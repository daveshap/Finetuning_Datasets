COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay shorter?
COACH: Well, there are a few ways to do that. First, you can look at your essay and see if there are any areas that could be trimmed down or rephrased. You can also try to use shorter words and sentences to make the essay more concise. Finally, you could look for any unnecessary details or information that could be removed without affecting the overall message of the essay.
