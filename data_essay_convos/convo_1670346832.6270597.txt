COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for some advice on how to write a good college essay. I'm from the Philippines and I'm applying to Harvard.
COACH: Great! It's always exciting to apply to a prestigious university like Harvard. Can you tell me more about yourself and why you're interested in attending Harvard?
STUDENT: Well, I'm a student in the Philippines and I'm interested in pursuing a degree in Buddhism. I'm also interested in learning more about German culture. I feel like I'm not very interesting as a person, so I'm not sure how to make my essay stand out.
COACH: That's a great start! You don't need to be "interesting" to have a great essay. What makes you unique is your combination of experiences, interests, and perspectives. Let's focus on that. Can you tell me more about your experience studying Buddhism and why you want to learn more about German culture? 
STUDENT: Sure. I've been studying Buddhism for the past few years and I'm really passionate about it. I'm also interested in learning more about German culture because I think it will help me understand the world better. I'm hoping to gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and beliefs.
COACH: That's a great goal! Now, let's talk about how you can make your essay stand out. What do you think makes you unique and sets you apart from other applicants?
STUDENT: I think my unique background and combination of experiences set me apart from other applicants. I'm from the Philippines and I'm passionate about Buddhism and learning more about German culture. I'm also interested in exploring different cultures and beliefs. I believe this combination of experiences will give me a unique perspective that I can share with others.
COACH: That's a great point! You can use your essay to show how your unique background and experiences have shaped your worldview and how they will benefit you in college. How do you think you can best convey this in your essay?
STUDENT: I think I can best convey this by talking about specific experiences I've had that have shaped my worldview. I can talk about my experience studying Buddhism and my interest in German culture, and explain how these experiences have helped me gain a better understanding of the world. I can also talk about how I plan to use my unique perspective to contribute to the Harvard community.
