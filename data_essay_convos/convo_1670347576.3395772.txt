COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm having trouble getting started. I'm a first-generation college student applying to universities in Germany and I'm having a difficult time articulating my skills and achievements.
COACH: That's understandable. It can be intimidating to write about yourself and your accomplishments when applying to a university. What do you think is the biggest obstacle you are facing as you get started on this essay?
STUDENT: Well, I think the biggest obstacle is rejection. I'm afraid that if I don't do a good job of talking about my skills and achievements, I won't get accepted.
COACH: That's a valid concern. But it's important to remember that rejection is a normal part of life, and it doesn't mean you can't achieve your goals. So, let's focus on the positive and talk about how you can use your skills and achievements to your advantage. What do you think are your strongest skills and achievements?
