COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to college and I'm having trouble writing my admission essay.
COACH: That's understandable. An admission essay is a very important part of the college application process. It's a chance for you to showcase your accomplishments, experiences, and goals. It's also an opportunity to convey your personality and help the admissions committee get to know who you are. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're struggling with?
STUDENT: I'm not sure how to make my essay stand out from other applicants.
COACH: That's a great question. One way to make sure your essay stands out is to focus on a unique experience or perspective that you can bring to the college. Think about what makes you unique and use that to your advantage. It could be a personal story, a hobby, a special skill, or something else that sets you apart from other applicants. You can also highlight any challenges you've faced and how you've overcome them. This will show the admissions committee that you have resilience and determination. 
STUDENT: Alright, I think I understand. But what if I'm applying to law school?
COACH: When applying to law school, it's important to demonstrate your knowledge of the law, as well as your commitment to the profession. You want to show that you have a passion for the law and that you are well-suited to a career in the field. You can do this by discussing your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and any volunteer work or internships you've done related to the law. Additionally, you should explain why you are interested in attending law school and what you hope to gain from the experience. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. But what about after I graduate? How do I find a job?
COACH: Finding a job after college can be a daunting task, but there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of success. First, you should start researching potential employers and industries that interest you. You can also reach out to your college's career center for advice and resources. Additionally, networking is key when it comes to finding a job. Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with people you meet who may be able to help you find a job. Finally, make sure your resume is up to date and tailored to the job you're applying for. 
STUDENT: Okay, I think I understand. But what if I'm a refugee?
COACH: As a refugee, you may face some additional challenges when it comes to finding a job. However, there are still many opportunities available. You can start by researching organizations that specialize in helping refugees find employment. Additionally, many employers value the unique skills and perspectives that refugees bring to the workplace. Make sure to highlight these on your resume and during job interviews. Finally, don't be afraid to reach out to people in your network who may be able to help you find a job.
