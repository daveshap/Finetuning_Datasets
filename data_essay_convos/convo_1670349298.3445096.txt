COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Duke University and I'm having trouble writing my essay.
COACH: Alright, let's see what we can do. What kind of essay are you trying to write?
STUDENT: It's for the engineering program.
COACH: Got it. So what kind of topics are you considering for your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to talk about growing up in a single parent home and how that has shaped my passion for engineering and my desire to pursue a graduate degree.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! Tell me more about your experience with growing up in a single parent home and how it has impacted your interest in engineering.
STUDENT: Well, my mom was always working hard to provide for us and she instilled in me a strong work ethic. She also emphasized the importance of education and encouraged me to explore my interests. As a result, I was drawn to engineering and have been passionate about it ever since. I want to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world, which is why I'm interested in pursuing a graduate degree.
COACH: That's wonderful! It sounds like your experience has given you a strong sense of purpose and ambition. How do you plan to incorporate this into your essay?
STUDENT: I plan to focus on how my upbringing has helped me develop the qualities that make me a strong candidate for the engineering program at Duke University. I want to emphasize how my dedication to learning and my passion for engineering have been shaped by my experiences growing up in a single parent home.
COACH: That sounds like a great approach! Showing how your experiences have shaped your values and goals will really help you stand out in your essay. Have you started writing it yet?
