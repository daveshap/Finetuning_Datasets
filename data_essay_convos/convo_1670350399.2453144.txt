COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for help with my college essay. I'm applying to Yale, UNC, and Harvard and I need some help making sure my essay stands out.
COACH: That's great! Let's start by talking a little bit about why college matters to you. What are your thoughts on the importance of college?
STUDENT: Well, I think college is important because it provides so many opportunities that wouldn't be available otherwise. It can open up doors to better job prospects, higher salaries, and a more successful career.
COACH: That's a great answer. What else do you think college can provide?
STUDENT: College can also help you develop important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. It can also give you the opportunity to network and meet people from different backgrounds. Plus, college can be a great way to learn more about yourself and who you want to become.
COACH: Those are all really great points. Do you have anything specific that you want to focus on in your essay?

I also want to highlight the steps that universities can take to create a more equitable and inclusive environment. Finally, I want to discuss the importance of using our voices to fight for change and how we can all work together to create a better future.
