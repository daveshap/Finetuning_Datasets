COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Yale and I'm having trouble with my essay. I'm trying to tell a story about how my experience in Thailand shaped my understanding of Islam.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic for your essay. Can you tell me more about your experience in Thailand?
STUDENT: Sure. I was there for a month and I visited several mosques and talked to many people about their faith. It was really eye-opening to see how different cultures practice the same religion.
COACH: That's really interesting. What did you learn from the experience that you want to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I learned that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. I also learned that there are different interpretations of the faith and that it's important to be open-minded when discussing it.
COACH: That's a great point to make in your essay. What else do you think is important to include?
STUDENT: I think it's important to talk about how my experience in Thailand made me more open-minded and tolerant of other cultures. I also want to discuss how it has impacted my future plans, such as my desire to find a job after college that allows me to work in international settings.
COACH: That sounds like a great idea. I'd suggest focusing on how this experience helped shape your values and goals, and how it has motivated you to pursue a career in international affairs. You can also use this opportunity to explain why you're applying to Yale and how the university can help you reach your goals.
