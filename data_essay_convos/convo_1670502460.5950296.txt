COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: why does an admission essay matter?
COACH: An admissions essay is a great way for the admissions committee to get to know you as an individual. It can help them understand your values, experiences, motivations, and goals. It can also help them determine if you are a good fit for their program. By providing a well-written essay, you can show that you are serious about your application and demonstrate your commitment to the program.
