COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I am trying to write an essay about my experience as a refugee in France.
COACH: That sounds like a really interesting topic. Can you tell me more about what you want to focus on in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to talk about the racism and sexism that I experienced in France as a refugee.
COACH: That's a really important topic to discuss. What are some of the specific experiences that you want to highlight in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to talk about how I was treated differently because of my race and gender. I also want to talk about how I felt like I wasn't seen as an equal.
COACH: That's a really powerful story. How do you think you can best capture your experience in your essay?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I feel like I'm not interesting as a person, so I'm not sure how to make my story compelling.
COACH: Don't worry, everyone has a story to tell. You don't have to be interesting to make your essay compelling. Instead, focus on the emotions that you experienced during your time in France. Describe how it felt to be treated differently and how it made you feel. That will make your essay more powerful and engaging.
