COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Yale and MIT, and I'm having trouble deciding what to write about. I'm interested in exploring my Jewish heritage, but I'm not sure if that's a good topic for my essay.
COACH: That's a great question. It really depends on what the admissions officers are looking for in your essay. Generally speaking, admissions officers want to know why you are a good fit for their school, what makes you unique, and what experiences you have that make you stand out from other applicants. If your Jewish heritage is an important part of who you are, then it could be a great topic for your essay. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. What else should I consider when writing my essay?
COACH: First, think about what experiences you have had that have shaped your identity and your worldview. Do you have any meaningful stories or lessons that you can share? These could be related to your faith, your family, your education, or anything else that has made an impact on your life. You could also talk about your academic interests and how they have shaped your goals and ambitions. Finally, consider the specific qualities that make you the ideal candidate for the school you're applying to, such as leadership skills, a commitment to service, or an impressive academic record. All of these things can help you create a compelling essay that will show admissions officers why you should be accepted. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful. One last question: How can I make sure my essay stands out among the many applications?
COACH: A great way to make your essay stand out is to focus on topics that are unique to you. Think about what sets you apart from other applicants, and use that to your advantage. It could be something about your background, your experiences, or your passions. Also, make sure to be honest and authentic in your writing. Admissions officers want to get to know the real you, so don't be afraid to be vulnerable and share your true story. Finally, don't forget to proofread your essay and make sure it is free from grammar and spelling errors. This will show admissions officers that you are serious about your application.
