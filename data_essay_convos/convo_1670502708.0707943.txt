STUDENT: what do I write about in my college admission essay?
COACH: That's a great question. It really depends on what you want the admissions committee to know about you. You can write about your life experiences, your personal qualities, or your goals and aspirations. The important thing is to make sure your essay conveys your personality and tells a story that will help the admissions committee get to know you better.

A typical structure for an admissions essay includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. In the introduction, you should provide some background information about yourself and explain why you are applying to the school. In the body paragraphs, you should discuss the experiences that have shaped you, your skills and qualities, and your goals for the future. Finally, in the conclusion, you should summarize your main points and reiterate why you believe you would be a great addition to the school.

You can also include stories and anecdotes to illustrate your points. Make sure to be honest and authentic in your writing. The admissions committee is looking for genuine applicants who are passionate about their field of study.
