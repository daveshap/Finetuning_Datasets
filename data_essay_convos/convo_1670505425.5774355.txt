STUDENT: how do scholarships work?
COACH: Scholarships are financial awards given to students based on their academic performance, financial need, or other criteria. Generally, students must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for a scholarship. For example, some scholarships may require that students have a certain GPA or demonstrate financial need. Other scholarships may be based on specific interests or talents, such as sports or music.
