STUDENT: how do grants work?
COACH: Grants are a type of financial aid that don't need to be repaid. They are usually awarded based on financial need or academic merit. To apply for grants, you will need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). It's important to note that not all grants are the same and some may have specific requirements.
