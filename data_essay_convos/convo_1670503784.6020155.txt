COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: A good conclusion should be short and sweet. It should summarize the main points of your essay and leave the reader with a lasting impression. You can also use the conclusion to reiterate why you are the ideal candidate for the law school program. Make sure to include a call to action, so that the reader is left wanting to learn more about you.
