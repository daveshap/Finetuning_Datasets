COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm writing an essay about overcoming obstacles and I need some help.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting topic. What kind of obstacles are you talking about?
STUDENT: Well, I come from a poor family and I've faced a lot of rejection in my life.
COACH: That's a difficult situation to be in. How have you managed to overcome those obstacles?
STUDENT: I've worked hard to do well in school and I'm now applying to universities in Europe and the US. I'm hoping to get into MIT and I'm really passionate about Buddhism.
COACH: That's impressive! So, how do these experiences tie into your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I want to talk about how I've been able to use my experiences to my advantage, and how my Buddhist beliefs have helped me stay positive and motivated.
COACH: That's a great idea. Have you started writing yet?
STUDENT: Yes, I have a rough outline but I'm stuck on how to structure the essay.
COACH: Okay, let's start by breaking down your main points. What are the key ideas that you want to discuss?
STUDENT: I want to talk about how I've been able to use my experiences to my advantage, how my Buddhist beliefs have helped me stay positive and motivated, and how I plan to use my education to help others in similar situations.
COACH: Great. Now, let's think about how to structure your essay. What kind of order do you want to present your points in?
STUDENT: I think I want to start with my background and how I overcame my obstacles, then discuss my Buddhist beliefs, and finish with my plans for the future.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. Let's break it down further and think about how you can make each point more specific and detailed.
