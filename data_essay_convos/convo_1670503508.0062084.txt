COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: what makes an essay engaging?
COACH: An engaging essay is one that has a strong narrative structure, vivid details, and an emotional connection with the reader. It should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and should be written in a way that makes the reader want to keep reading. It should also include personal reflections and insights that make it unique to you.
