COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm an undergrad student applying to NCSU and Yale. I'm having trouble understanding why my admission essay is so important.
COACH: That's a great question! Your admission essay is a key element of the application process, as it gives admissions officers a sense of who you are as a person. It's your chance to show them what makes you unique and why you would be a great fit for their school. By writing a compelling essay, you can demonstrate your knowledge, values, and passion for the subject you're applying to. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. What kind of topics should I focus on?
COACH: It really depends on the school and the program you're applying to. However, in general, you should focus on topics that you're passionate about, such as politics, current events, and social issues. You should also focus on demonstrating your knowledge of the subject you're applying to, such as discussing the history, theories, and current trends related to the field. You can also discuss how your personal experiences have shaped your perspective and outlook on the subject.
STUDENT: Okay, I think I understand. Is there anything else I should consider when writing my essay?
COACH: Absolutely! Make sure you proofread your essay carefully and have someone else review it as well. It's also important to make sure your essay is well-structured and organized, and that you use clear and concise language throughout. Additionally, make sure you follow any instructions given by the admissions office, such as word count or formatting requirements. Finally, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to write and revise your essay, as this will help you create a strong, polished final product.
