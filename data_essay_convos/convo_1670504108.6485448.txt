COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question! It's hard to know when an essay is finished, as there's always more you can do to refine it. A good way to know when your essay is finished is to read it over and ask yourself if it says what you want it to say. Does it answer the prompt? Does it make a strong argument? Does it have a clear structure and thesis statement? If you can answer yes to all of these questions, then your essay is probably finished.
