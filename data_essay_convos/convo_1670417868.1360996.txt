COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to MIT, Princeton, and Harvard and I'm really struggling with my essay. I'm not sure what admissions officers look for and I'm worried that I'm too boring.
COACH: That's understandable. It can be overwhelming to write an essay for such prestigious universities. First off, let's talk about your topic. What do you want to write about?
STUDENT: I'm thinking of writing about my experience volunteering at a homeless shelter. I think it could show how I'm passionate about helping people.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! Volunteering is a great way to demonstrate your commitment to service and it can also show admissions officers that you have a sense of empathy. When writing your essay, make sure to focus on a specific moment or experience that you had while volunteering. This will help make your essay more interesting and engaging. Also, don't forget to explain why you chose to volunteer and how it has impacted you. These details will help the admissions officers get to know you better.
