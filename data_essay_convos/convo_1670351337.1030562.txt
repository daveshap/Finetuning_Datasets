COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm trying to apply for college and I'm having trouble writing my essay.
COACH: That's understandable. What is the essay about?
STUDENT: It's about how growing up in a poor family has shaped my worldview and how I plan to use my education to make a difference in the fight against racism.
COACH: That's a great topic. Can you tell me more about your background and what you want to achieve with your essay?
STUDENT: Sure. I grew up in a low-income family and had to struggle with financial issues throughout my childhood. I've seen firsthand the impact of racism on people in my community and I want to use my education to help create a more equitable society.
COACH: That's admirable. What do you think admissions officers will be looking for when they read your essay?
STUDENT: I think they'll be looking for evidence of my commitment to making a difference, my understanding of the issues, and my dedication to using my education to tackle these problems.
COACH: That sounds like a great approach. How can you demonstrate those qualities in your essay?
STUDENT: I plan to focus on my personal experiences and how they have shaped my views on racism. I also want to highlight my dedication to using my education to create a better future for everyone.
COACH: Those are great ideas. Now, let's talk about financing your undergrad studies. How do you plan to pay for college?
STUDENT: I'm hoping to get some financial aid, but I'm also looking into scholarships and grants. I'm also considering taking out student loans if necessary.
COACH: That's a great approach. Make sure you research all your options thoroughly and don't forget to apply for any scholarships or grants that you may be eligible for.
Good luck with your essay!
