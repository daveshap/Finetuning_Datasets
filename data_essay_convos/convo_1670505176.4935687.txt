COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i make my essay more engaging?
COACH: One way to make your essay more engaging is to tell a story. Try to think of an event or experience in your life that you can use to illustrate a point or show your personality. You can also use vivid details to make your essay more interesting. For example, instead of saying, “I love music”, you could say, “The sound of the saxophone solo in my favorite jazz song fills me with joy and brings a smile to my face every time I hear it.” 
STUDENT: What should I focus on when writing a college admissions essay? 
COACH: When writing a college admissions essay, it’s important to focus on what makes you unique. Think about what sets you apart from other applicants and how you can show the admissions committee why you would be a great fit for their school. Make sure to include relevant details about yourself, such as your academic accomplishments, extracurricular activities, and any special talents you may have. Most importantly, be honest and authentic in your writing.
