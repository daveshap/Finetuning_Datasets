COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm writing an essay about social issues and I'm having trouble finding a unique angle.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! What kind of social issues are you interested in?
STUDENT: Well, I'm particularly interested in how young people can find jobs after college in the Philippines.
COACH: That's a great topic! What kind of research have you done so far?
STUDENT: I've read some articles and books about the current job market in the Philippines, but I'm still struggling to find a unique angle for my essay.
COACH: Have you considered looking at how Buddhism might influence the way people approach their job search?
STUDENT: That's a great idea! I hadn't thought of that.
COACH: It could be a really interesting angle to explore. What do you think admissions officers would be looking for in an essay like this?
STUDENT: I think they'd be looking for a unique perspective on the issue and something that really stands out from the crowd.
