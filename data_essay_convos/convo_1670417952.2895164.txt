COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UNC for college and I'm having trouble writing my essay. 
COACH: Alright, let's start by talking about why college matters to you. Can you tell me a bit about your background and what has motivated you to pursue higher education?
STUDENT: Well, I'm from a single parent home and I've seen how hard my mom works to make ends meet. I want to go to college so that I can use my education to help people in similar situations, and to make a difference in the world.
COACH: That's great. It sounds like you have a strong sense of purpose and a desire to make the world a better place. What kind of social issues are you most passionate about?
STUDENT: I'm really interested in poverty and homelessness. I think it's unacceptable that so many people in our society are living in poverty and don't have access to basic necessities. I want to do something to help.
COACH: That's admirable. Have you done any charity work or volunteer work related to these issues?
STUDENT: Yes, I've volunteered at a local homeless shelter and I've helped organize fundraisers for various causes. I've also done some research on poverty and homelessness and presented my findings at a few conferences.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you have a lot of experience and knowledge related to social issues. So, how would you apply this knowledge to your college experience and what would you hope to get out of it?
STUDENT: I want to use my college experience to gain a deeper understanding of poverty and homelessness, and to learn how to create sustainable solutions. I also want to be able to use my education to advocate for social justice and to help those in need. Ultimately, I want to use my college experience to become a better leader and to make a positive impact on the world.
