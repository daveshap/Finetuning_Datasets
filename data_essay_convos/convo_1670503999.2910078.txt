COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know if my essay is good?
COACH: Thatâ€™s a great question! The best way to know if your essay is good is to review it with a critical eye. Read it out loud and ask yourself if it flows, makes sense, and if it accurately reflects your story and personality. You can also get feedback from someone you trust, such as a teacher, mentor, or family member.
