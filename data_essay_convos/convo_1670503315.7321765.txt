COACH: That's a great question. Scholarships and grants are typically awarded based on financial need, academic achievement, or special talents or interests. To find out what scholarships and grants you may be eligible for, you should start by researching the different types of scholarships and grants available. You can also check with your school counselor or college admissions office to see if they have any resources to help you. Additionally, many organizations and businesses offer scholarships and grants so be sure to look into those as well.
