COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi! I'm an undergrad who is applying to Princeton and I'm not sure how the college admission process works.
COACH: That's a great question! The college admission process is a complex one, but I can break it down for you. Generally, the first step is to fill out an application. This application will include basic information about you such as your name, address, and contact information. It will also include information about your academic background, extracurricular activities, and any awards or honors you have received. Once you have completed the application, you will submit it to the college or university of your choice. 
After that, the college will review your application and decide whether or not to accept you. They will look at your grades, test scores, and other factors to make their decision. If you are accepted, you will then receive an acceptance letter from the school. 
STUDENT: Wow, that's a lot of information! I'm also curious about what I should do after I finish college. How would I go about finding a job?
COACH: Finding a job after college can be a challenging process, but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances. First, you should start networking with people in your field of interest. Reach out to professionals and ask them for advice. You can also attend career fairs, join professional organizations, and create a strong online presence. These steps can help you make connections and find opportunities. Additionally, you should research potential employers and apply to jobs that fit your skills and interests. 
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'm also feeling a bit overwhelmed because I don't feel like I have anything interesting to say in my essay. What should I do?
COACH: Don't worry - everyone feels this way at some point! One way to make your essay stand out is to focus on your unique experiences and perspective. Think about what makes you unique and how that sets you apart from other applicants. What experiences have shaped you as a person? How have those experiences impacted your goals and values? Writing about these topics can help you share your story in an interesting and meaningful way.
