COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to college and I want to write an essay about my experience as a Jewish refugee.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic to explore! Can you tell me more about your experience? What has been the most challenging part of being a Jewish refugee?
STUDENT: The most challenging part has been trying to find a place where I can feel accepted and understood. I'm neurodiverse, so it's been hard to find a community that understands my needs and respects my differences.
COACH: That must be difficult. How have you been able to cope with the challenges?
STUDENT: I've tried to focus on the things that make me unique and special. I've also been reading a lot about Judaism and learning more about my culture and heritage. That has really helped me to feel more connected to my identity.
COACH: That's great that you're exploring your heritage and culture. Have you thought about how you might use this experience in your essay?
STUDENT: Yes, I think I could use this experience to show admissions officers how I'm able to rise above adversity and still strive for success. I want to show them that even though I'm a refugee, I'm still capable of achieving my goals and attending a school like MIT.
COACH: That's a great idea! I think it would be really powerful to tell your story in a way that shows your resilience and determination. What do you think are some of the key points you'd like to emphasize in your essay?
STUDENT: I want to emphasize my ability to adapt to different environments and cultures, my commitment to learning more about my heritage and culture, and my determination to succeed despite the odds. I also want to show that I'm a good fit for MIT, and that I have the potential to be a successful student there.
