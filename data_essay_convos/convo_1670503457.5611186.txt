COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do I find a job after college?
COACH: That's a great question. Writing a college admissions essay isn't just about what you want to do after college, but rather how you plan to get there. You can start by brainstorming topics that are related to your goals and what you think will make you a successful candidate for the college. Think of experiences you've had, skills you've developed, and qualities that make you unique. Once you have some ideas, you can start to craft an essay that will help you stand out from other applicants.
