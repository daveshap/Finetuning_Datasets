COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Princeton and I'm trying to write an essay about neurodiversity and how it has impacted my life. I'm having trouble figuring out the best way to structure my essay.
COACH: That's a great topic! Neurodiversity is an important social issue that needs to be discussed more. Before we get into the structure of your essay, can you tell me more about your experiences with neurodiversity?
STUDENT: Sure. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was young and it has been a major challenge for me throughout my life. I've had to work harder than most people to keep up with schoolwork and other activities. I've also faced discrimination and stigma because of my diagnosis.
COACH: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you have faced a lot of challenges in your life due to neurodiversity. Now, let's talk about how to structure your essay. Have you given any thought to how you want to organize your essay?
STUDENT: I was thinking of starting with a general introduction, talking about what neurodiversity is and why it's important. Then I was going to discuss my experience with ADHD and how it has impacted my life. After that, I wanted to talk about the discrimination and stigma I've faced because of my diagnosis. Finally, I wanted to end with a call to action for more awareness and acceptance of neurodiversity.
COACH: That sounds like a great structure for your essay! I think it's important to emphasize the importance of neurodiversity and the challenges that come with it. You could also include stories from your own life to illustrate your points. For example, you could talk about how you overcame obstacles due to your diagnosis, or how your family has been affected by your diagnosis. This could help to further illustrate your points and make your essay more powerful.
