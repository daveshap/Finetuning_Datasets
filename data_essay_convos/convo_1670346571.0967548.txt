COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for help with writing an essay about my experiences as a Muslim student studying engineering.
COACH: Alright, let's start by talking about your experiences. What have been some of the biggest challenges and successes you've had as a Muslim engineering student?
STUDENT: Well, one of the biggest challenges has been balancing my religious beliefs with my studies. As a Muslim, I'm expected to follow certain religious practices that can interfere with my studies, like praying five times a day or fasting during Ramadan. It's been a challenge to find ways to make sure I'm still able to focus on my studies while still fulfilling my religious obligations.
On the other hand, one of my biggest successes has been being able to use my engineering skills to develop solutions that help my community. For example, I recently created a solar-powered water purification system for a nearby village. It was a great feeling to be able to use my engineering skills to help people in need.
COACH: That's great! It sounds like you've had a lot of success in both your religious life and your engineering career. It also sounds like you've had to be very creative in finding solutions to balance the two. How have these experiences helped you grow as a person?
STUDENT: Definitely. It's taught me how to be resilient and flexible when faced with difficult challenges. I've had to learn how to adjust my plans and find new solutions when things don't go as expected. It's also helped me become more confident in my ability to solve problems, both big and small.
COACH: That's wonderful. It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experience to draw from in your essay. What other topics are you hoping to include in your essay?
STUDENT: Well, I was thinking of talking about how I plan to use my engineering skills after college. I'm interested in exploring how I can use my skills to find a job that aligns with my values. I'm also interested in discussing how I plan to finance my college education.
COACH: Those are both important topics. Let's start with how you plan to use your engineering skills after college. Can you tell me more about what kind of job you're looking for and what skills and achievements you think will be most important?
STUDENT: Sure. I'm looking for a job that allows me to use my engineering skills to create something meaningful and make a positive impact on the world. I'm also looking for a job that allows me to practice my religious beliefs, so I'm hoping to find a company that is open to accommodating my needs. As far as skills and achievements, I think my experience in developing the solar-powered water purification system and my ability to think creatively and solve problems will be important.
COACH: That sounds like a great plan. And what about financing your college education? What kind of resources are you looking into and what strategies have you come up with?
STUDENT: I'm looking into scholarships, grants, and loans to help finance my education. I'm also looking into work-study programs and internships that can help me pay for school. I'm trying to come up with a plan that will allow me to focus on my studies and still have enough money to cover my tuition and living expenses.
