COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm looking for help with my college admissions essay.
COACH: Great! What kind of help do you need? Do you have a topic in mind?
STUDENT: I'm thinking about writing about a social issue that has impacted me or my community, but I'm not sure how to approach it.
COACH: That sounds like a great topic! When you're writing about a social issue, it's important to remember that admissions officers are looking for an essay that is both personal and reflective. You want to be sure to include both your own experiences and observations, as well as your thoughts and feelings on the issue.
It's also important to think about the structure of your essay. Are you planning on writing a narrative essay, or a persuasive essay?
STUDENT: I think I want to write a narrative essay.
COACH: Okay, great! Narrative essays are a great way to tell a story and share your experiences. When writing a narrative essay, it's important to focus on the main points and make sure that each paragraph has a clear purpose. It's also important to think about how you can use your own experiences to illustrate the larger point you're trying to make about the social issue.
Also, when writing about a social issue, it's important to be aware of potential biases and assumptions. Make sure to include multiple perspectives on the issue and be respectful of different opinions.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'm also a little worried about rejection. What should I do if my essay gets rejected?
COACH: Rejection can be tough, but it doesn't have to be the end of the road. First, it's important to remember that getting rejected isn't necessarily a reflection of your ability or worth. It simply means that the essay didn't meet the expectations of the admissions office.
If your essay does get rejected, try to look at it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Ask yourself what you could have done differently, and use that knowledge to make your next essay even better. Don't be afraid to reach out to the admissions office for feedback, either. They may be able to provide some helpful insights into why your essay wasn't accepted.
Finally, don't forget to celebrate your successes! Even if your essay isn't accepted, you've still accomplished something by writing it. Celebrate that accomplishment and keep pushing forward.
