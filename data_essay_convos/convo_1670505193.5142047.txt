COACH: One way to make your essay more engaging is to use vivid language and imagery. This means using words that evoke strong emotions or images in the reader's mind. You can also use metaphors, similes, and analogies to make your essay more engaging. Additionally, you can make your essay more engaging by including anecdotes or stories. These can help to draw the reader in and make them more interested in your essay.
