COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i know when my essay is finished?
COACH: That's a great question! An essay is finished when you have addressed all the points that you wanted to make, and you are confident that you have communicated your ideas in a clear and concise way. You should also make sure that your essay has been proofread and edited for any errors. Once you have done all of that, then you can consider your essay finished.
