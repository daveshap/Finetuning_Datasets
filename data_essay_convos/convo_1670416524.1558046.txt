COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to law school and I want to know what admissions officers are looking for in an essay.
COACH: That's a great question! Admissions officers are usually looking for essays that demonstrate a student's intellectual curiosity, academic ability, and commitment to their chosen field of study. They want to see evidence of resilience, creativity, and passion for the law. Additionally, they may be interested in a student's travel experience, volunteer work, or any other activities that show their dedication to the legal profession.
STUDENT: I'm applying to UCLA and I'm a bit worried about my essay. What kind of topics should I focus on?
COACH: UCLA is a highly competitive school, so you want to make sure your essay stands out from the crowd. Focus on topics that show your unique perspective and experiences. You could talk about any challenges you've faced in your life and how they've shaped your outlook on law. You could also discuss any travel experiences you've had that have impacted your understanding of the law. Additionally, if you've done any volunteer work related to the law, that could be a great topic to explore. 
STUDENT: I do have some volunteer experience, but it wasn't related to the law. Would that still be a good topic to write about?
COACH: Absolutely! Volunteer work is a great way to demonstrate your commitment to helping others and making a difference in the world. Admissions officers will be impressed by your willingness to give back to your community. Even if your volunteer work isn't directly related to the law, you can still use it as an opportunity to discuss how it has impacted your views on justice and your interest in pursuing a career in law.
