COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to Yale and Duke for medical school and I'm wondering what admissions officers look for in the essay.
COACH: That's a great question! It's important to remember that each university has different expectations, so it's important to research and understand what each university is looking for. Generally speaking, admissions officers are looking for essays that demonstrate your academic ability, passion for medicine, and commitment to the field. They want to see that you have the skills, knowledge, and dedication to make a successful doctor. 
STUDENT: That makes sense. What else should I be focusing on in my essay?
COACH: Well, it's important to focus on your unique experiences and how they have shaped or influenced your decision to pursue medicine. For example, if you have any experience in China, it might be worth mentioning how that experience has informed your understanding of the medical field. You can also talk about your journey to becoming a doctor, your motivations, and your goals. Ultimately, you want to show that you have the drive and commitment to succeed in medical school and beyond.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. What else should I keep in mind when writing my essay?
COACH: It's important to make sure your essay is well-structured and clearly written. Make sure to proofread and edit your essay carefully, as admissions officers will be looking for mistakes. Additionally, make sure to be honest and authentic in your essay. Admissions officers want to get to know you as a person, so be sure to let your personality shine through. Finally, make sure to follow all instructions and guidelines given by the university. Good luck!
