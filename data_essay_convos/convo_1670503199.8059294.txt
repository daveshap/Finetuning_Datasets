COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: first generation college student?
COACH: Yes, that's a great topic to focus on. You can talk about how you are the first in your family to go to college, and how it has been a challenge for you. You can also talk about how you have had to learn and grow in order to reach this point in your life, and how you are determined to make the most of this opportunity. 
STUDENT: What kind of structure should I use for my essay?
COACH: A good structure for your essay would be to start with an introduction that introduces the topic, then move into the body paragraphs which will provide more detail about your experience as a first-generation college student. You can discuss challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and how your experience has shaped who you are today. Finally, you can wrap up your essay with a conclusion that ties everything together and emphasizes the importance of your story.
