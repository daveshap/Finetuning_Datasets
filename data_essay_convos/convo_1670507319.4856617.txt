COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good conclusion?
COACH: That's a great question. Before we get into how to write a good conclusion, can you tell me a bit more about the essay you're writing? What type of essay is it, and what is the purpose of it?
STUDENT: It is a personal statement for medical school. The purpose is to explain why I am an ideal candidate for the program. 
COACH: Got it. When writing a conclusion for a personal statement, it's important to think about what you want the reader to take away from your essay. Your conclusion should sum up your main points and provide a sense of closure. It should be clear, concise, and memorable. 
To start, you'll want to restate the main points of your essay. This will remind the reader of the main points you made throughout the essay and reiterate why you are a good fit for the program. You could also include a brief summary of any relevant experiences or skills that you have that make you a great candidate. 
Next, you'll want to add a few sentences that tie everything together and leave the reader with a lasting impression. This could be a quote, an anecdote, or a call to action. Whatever it is, make sure it reflects the overall message of your essay. 
Finally, end your essay with a powerful statement that leaves the reader with a positive feeling about you and your application. 
I hope this helps! Do you have any other questions about writing a conclusion for your personal statement?
