COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how does financing college work?
COACH: That's a great question. Financing college can be a complex process, so let's break it down. First, you'll want to research the different types of financial aid available, such as scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study programs. You'll also want to look into the cost of tuition at the colleges you're considering. Once you have an idea of your options and the costs involved, you can begin to make a plan for how you'll pay for college. 
STUDENT: What do I need to know about writing a monograph?
COACH: A monograph is a type of essay that focuses on a single topic or argument. When writing a monograph, you'll want to start by doing some research and gathering evidence to support your argument. You'll also want to think about the structure of your essay and how to best present your ideas. Additionally, you'll want to make sure you use proper grammar and spelling, and that your essay is free of any typos. Finally, you'll want to proofread your essay to make sure it meets the requirements of the assignment.
