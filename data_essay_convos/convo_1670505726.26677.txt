COACH: Start by writing down your accomplishments, experiences, and goals. Think about how they all relate to why you want to pursue a career in medicine. You should also consider how your personal story can help illustrate why you are a good fit for the medical school you are applying to. Additionally, make sure to include any unique qualities or skills you possess that will make you stand out as a medical student.
