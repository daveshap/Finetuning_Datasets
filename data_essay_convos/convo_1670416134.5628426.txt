STUDENT: Hi, I'm a first-generation college student applying to North Carolina State University and need help with my personal statement.
COACH: That's great! I'm happy to help. Tell me a bit about yourself and what you want to study.
STUDENT: Well, I'm interested in engineering and I think NCSU would be a great fit for me. I'm really passionate about engineering and I want to make sure I present myself in the best light in my personal statement.
COACH: That's fantastic! It sounds like you have a clear goal and vision for your future. Let's talk about some of your skills and achievements that you can include in your statement. What have you accomplished so far that you're proud of? 
STUDENT: Well, I've been on the honor roll every semester since I started high school. I also volunteered at a local engineering firm last summer, which gave me some valuable experience.

You can also talk about the challenges you faced while working on these projects and how you overcame them. This will show the admissions committee your resilience and problem-solving skills.
