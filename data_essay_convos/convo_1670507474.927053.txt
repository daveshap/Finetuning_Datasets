COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: how do i write a good opening?
COACH: That's a great question. The opening of your essay is important because it sets the tone for the entire piece. It should introduce the topic, provide context, and give the reader an idea of what they can expect to learn from the essay. To make your opening stand out, try to make it creative and engaging. You can also use a quote, anecdote, or statistic to start off your essay in an interesting way.
