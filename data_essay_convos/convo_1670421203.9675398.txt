COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm applying to UCLA and I want to write an essay about politics and Islam.
COACH: Great! What specifically do you want to write about?
STUDENT: I want to explore how politics has impacted the Muslim community in the United States.
COACH: That's a great topic. Tell me more about what you want to focus on.
STUDENT: I want to talk about the discrimination that Muslims face in the US, and how this has affected their lives and their communities.
COACH: That's an important issue. What do you think are some of the main challenges that Muslims have faced in the US?
STUDENT: Well, there have been a lot of negative stereotypes about Muslims in the media, which has led to discrimination and prejudice. There have also been policies that have been put in place that have made it harder for Muslims to practice their religion freely.
COACH: Those are definitely issues that need to be addressed. Is there anything else you want to discuss in your essay?
STUDENT: I also want to talk about how Muslims have been able to use creativity and art to express themselves and fight back against discrimination.
COACH: That's a great idea. How do you plan to incorporate that into your essay?
STUDENT: I want to discuss how Muslims have used creativity and art to create positive narratives about their communities and to challenge negative stereotypes. I also want to talk about how art can be used as a form of protest and resistance.
COACH: That sounds like an interesting angle. Do you have any other ideas or thoughts that you want to include in your essay?
STUDENT: I'm not sure. I feel like I'm not very interesting as a person, so I don't know what else to write about. 
COACH: Don't worry, everyone has something interesting to say! Think about what you're passionate about and what makes you unique. What are some of your hobbies or interests?
