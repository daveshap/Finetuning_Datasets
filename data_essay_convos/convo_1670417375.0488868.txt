COACH: Hello, how can I help you with your essay?
STUDENT: Hi, I'm a high school student interested in applying to college and I'm looking for some guidance on the college application process.
COACH: Absolutely! That's what I'm here for. What kind of questions do you have about the college application process?
STUDENT: Well, I'm wondering how college admissions work. Is there a certain formula that colleges use to decide who gets accepted?
COACH: Great question! Generally speaking, colleges use a combination of factors when considering an applicant. These can include things like test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays, and letters of recommendation. It's important to remember that each college has its own admissions process, so it's best to research the individual requirements for each college you're applying to. 
STUDENT: Okay, that makes sense. I'm interested in applying to UCLA, so what should I know about the admissions process there?
COACH: UCLA is a highly competitive school, so it's important to make sure that your application stands out from the crowd. They look at a variety of factors, such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and essays. You'll also need to submit your standardized test scores, as well as letters of recommendation. It's also important to note that UCLA has a holistic review process, meaning they take into account the whole person, not just their academic achievements.
STUDENT: That's really helpful. I'm also interested in grad school, how does that process work?
COACH: The grad school application process is similar to the undergraduate process, with a few key differences. For one, grad schools typically look for a higher level of academic performance and professional experience. They also pay more attention to the quality of your essays and letters of recommendation. In addition, you'll need to submit GRE or GMAT scores, depending on the program you're applying to. Finally, you'll need to demonstrate that you have the financial resources to cover the cost of tuition and other related expenses. 
STUDENT: How does financing college work?
COACH: Financing college can be a daunting task, but there are several options available. You may be eligible for grants and scholarships, which are awarded based on financial need or academic merit. You can also apply for federal student loans, which are available to most students regardless of income. Additionally, some colleges offer their own loan programs, so it's worth researching these options as well. Finally, private lenders also offer student loans, though these tend to have higher interest rates and may require a cosigner.
